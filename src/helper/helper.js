Also I can access from anywhere. I don’t know all aspects of DBT yet , but I am sure this App will take me all the way there. Great job and thanks for saving my life. My nearest DBT Therapist is 100+ miles away'

    comment:'The app is fairly comprehensive. Seems like the developer has really understood DBT therapy, groups and what is involved with it. I was skeptical at first, but as I dug into it I realized how much detailed this is. I love the design. There\'s so much info packed in such a small form factor.'

Since I DO always have my device handy, this will improve tremendously my use of daily Diary cards. Further the content is so rich. I am a visual person - so the videos are perfect. There are so many features, I am just in love with it.'
