This app is so thorough that you don’t need anything else. I love the design, usability and how easy to access everything. Also, the most important me is the ability to share my entries with my therapist and constant feedback.',

Also I can access from anywhere. I don’t know all aspects of DBT yet , but I am sure this App will take me all the way there. Great job and thanks for saving my life. My nearest DBT Therapist is 100+ miles away.',

I love that can assign homework and assessments and my clients can submit them through the app. I have recommended to other clinicians in my practice who love this too. If your are looking for a platform that enables to better incorporate Evidence-Based therapy in your practice, I highly recommend Swasth.',

A skills group member told me today that I can do my worksheets on this app. Wow! I didn’t even realize that and I was still amazed by the app. The best thing about the app is, I can do all my homework from the skills group and one-on-one therapy in the app (which my therapist assigns) and she can see it in her clinician app. I rarely forget to do my diary entry and homework anymore.',

Since I DO always have my device handy, this will improve  tremendously my use of daily Diary cards. Further the content is so rich. I am a visual person - so the videos are perfect. There are so many features, I am just in love with it.    ',

The app taught me to switch off from autopilot and let go of negative thinking traps that have contributed to my depression and anxiety. I also found a kinder and more compassionate attitude towards myself and others, and I’ve learned to make decisions based on my values. These things were particularly important for me. The App offers a flexible way to do practices on my own but also to contact my therapist whenever more support and help is needed.',
