## **KNOWING SLEEP DISORDERS**

Sleep disorders involve problems with the quality, timing, and amount of sleep, which result in daytime distress and difficulty in functioning. Sleep disorders often occur along with medical conditions or other mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or cognitive disorders.

Sleep disorders cause more than just daytime sleepiness. They can take a serious toll on your mental and physical health, including your mood, energy, and ability to handle stress. Ignoring sleep problems and disorders can lead to weight gain, car accidents, impaired job performance, memory problems, and strained relationships. If you want to feel your best, stay healthy, and perform up to your potential, quality sleep is a necessity, not a luxury.

Frequently having trouble sleeping can be a frustrating and irritating experience. You sleep badly at night, which leaves you feeling dead-tired in the morning and whatever energy you have quickly drains throughout the day.

Lack of sleep and too much sleep are linked to many chronic health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. Sleep disturbances can also be a warning sign for medical and neurological problems, such as congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and Parkinson’s disease.

## **WHAT IS INSOMNIA?**

Insomnia is described by the recurring difficulty to fall or remain asleep despite motivation and other similar means. People with insomnia also experience excessive daytime sleepiness and other cognitive impairments while they are awake. Insomnia is considered a chronic condition when patients exhibit symptoms at least three times per week for at least three months.

People with insomnia face some serious problems and they affect their overall mental and physical health. The problems apart from difficulty in sleeping are:

• Depression

• Poor concentration

• Irritation

• Loss of appetite

• Impaired work or school performance. 

Insomnia is most prevalent among older adults and women.

## **CAUSES OF INSOMNIA**

There could be several factors that cause insomnia but the most common ones are as follows:

1. **Allergies and breathlessness**

Allergies, colds, and upper respiratory infections can make it difficult to breathe at night. The inability to breathe through your nose can also cause sleeping problems.

2.**Nocturia**

Nocturia, or frequent urination, can disturb your sleep by causing you to wake up during the night. 

3. **Chronic pain**

Chronic pain can make it highly challenging for anyone to fall asleep. It can wake you up even after you fall asleep. Some of the most common causes of chronic pain involve:

* Arthritis
* Excessive fatigue
* Fibromyalgia
* Irrational bowel syndrome
* Continuous headaches
* Persistent lower back pain

In some cases, chronic pain may even be triggered by sleep disorders. 

4. **Stress and anxiety**

It can be difficult for you to fall asleep or to stay asleep if you are stressing about something. Nightmares, sleep talking, or sleepwalking are some of the common symptoms in such cases.

## **Vicious Cycle of Insomnia and Poor Mental Health**



 Although many health care professionals as well as the public may minimize its importance, but insomnia may have short- and long-term consequences. At the very least, insomnia results in daytime fatigue, decreased mood, and general malaise. In more severe cases it may cause impaired occupational and social functioning. In addition, there is substantial evidence that insomnia dramatically increases risks for medical complaints, alcohol and drug abuse, and serious psychiatric illnesses. Moreover, insomnia alone contributes to increased health costs and utilization among affected individuals and, in turn, escalates health care costs for society in general.

Insomnia can straight up affect our state of mind. Long-term grief, anxiety and stress often disrupts our sleep patterns, which is why we often tend to stay awake when we are sad or stressed. Insomnia can cause mental health problems like depression, addiction issues etc. which in turn exacerbates insomnia. This is a vicious cycle. It's important to consult your doctor when you experience sleep problems to make sure any underlying medical condition isn't disrupting your sleep. Some people take the help of medicines to recover from insomnia and that can be useful, in the short term. 

## **CBT FOR INSOMNIA**

 Cognitive and behavioral treatments for sleep difficulties aim to improve sleep by changing poor sleep habits and challenging negative thoughts attitudes and beliefs about sleep. More specifically, the cognitive-behavioral component aims to change incorrect beliefs and attitudes about sleep (e.g., unrealistic expectations, misconceptions, amplifying consequences of sleeplessness); techniques include reattribution training (i.e., goal setting and planning coping responses),  reappraisal, and attention shifting. Thus, CBT attempts to alter patterns of negative thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes in order to foster more healthy and adaptive thoughts, emotions, and actions.
