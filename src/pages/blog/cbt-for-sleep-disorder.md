## **KNOWING SLEEP DISORDERS**

Sleep disorders involve problems with the quality, timing, and amount of sleep, which result in daytime distress and difficulty in functioning. Sleep disorders often occur along with medical conditions or other mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or cognitive disorders.

Sleep disorders cause more than just daytime sleepiness. They can take a serious toll on your mental and physical health, including your mood, energy, and ability to handle stress. Ignoring sleep problems and disorders can lead to weight gain, car accidents, impaired job performance, memory problems, and strained relationships. If you want to feel your best, stay healthy, and perform up to your potential, quality sleep is a necessity, not a luxury.

Frequently having trouble sleeping can be a frustrating and irritating experience. You sleep badly at night, which leaves you feeling dead-tired in the morning and whatever energy you have quickly drains throughout the day.

Lack of sleep and too much sleep are linked to many chronic health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. Sleep disturbances can also be a warning sign for medical and neurological problems, such as congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and Parkinson’s disease.
