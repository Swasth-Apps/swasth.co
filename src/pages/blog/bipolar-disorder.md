## **WHAT IS MOOD DISORDER?**

Mood disorders may include depression only (also known as “unipolar depression”) or they may include manic episodes (as in bipolar disorder, which is widely known as “manic depressive illness”). Individuals with mood disorders suffer significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, educational and other important areas of functioning. Individuals with depression feel worthless, sad and empty to the extent that these feelings impair effective functioning. They may also lose interest in their usual activities, experience a change in appetite, suffer from disturbed sleep or have decreased energy. Individuals with mania are overly energetic and may do things that are out of character, such as spending very freely and acquiring debt, breaking the law or showing lack of judgement in sexual behavior. These symptoms are severe and last for several weeks, interfering with relations and social life.

Mood disorders are at times referred to as affective disorder which is a tern that is further classified as depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, and other related disorders. The mood of a person can quickly change from depressed to sad, empty to euphoric, sad to happy and a lot more.

  ## UNDERSTANDING BIPOLAR DISORDER

  Bipolar disorders are common, disabling, recurrent mental health conditions. Onset often occurs in late childhood or early adolescence. Patients with bipolar disorders have higher rates of other mental health disorders and general medical conditions. The term Bipolar disorder means to have dual poles which refers to different emotional states of patients. It is categorized by the experience of changes in moods from extremely high to super low sensation of a particular emotion. These sudden changes in moods can significantly affect the social, mental and personal life of the person suffering from mood swings. Also, it is crucial to take into account that all the individuals suffering from this disorder do not always have the same experience. They are all different in their own ways.  Active management of body weight reduces complications and improves lipid control. Patients and their support systems should be educated about mood relapse, suicidal ideation, and the effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications.

  ## **CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES AND TYPES OF BIPOLAR DISORDER**

  The spectrum of bipolar disorder includes mania, hypomania and major depression. Although it is not mandatory to have experienced all the symptoms to get diagnosed for Bipolar disorder. Let us take a dive into the major characteristics of each type:

  **1. Manic episodes:** 

  MOOD ELEVATION: Under manic episode, a person's mood drastically change as it gets elevated sometimes, turns euphoric or becomes irritable. They might experience a lot of energy or may feel pressurized to keep on chatting, or speak quickly and become visible personally.

  DECREASED NEED FOR SLEEP: This is a common sign and usually an early or initial symptom of mania. The person with such a disorder may feel relieved only after a sleep of continuous 3 hours. Reduced sleep itself can stir manic episode.

  RAPID FLOW OF IDEAS: Persons suffering from mania may often process thoughts easily and throw them quickly without much thinking and interpretation. They are usually seem to jump from one idea to another pretty fast and their ideas do not seem logical most of the times. Such a behavior makes the communication irritating for the person in front.

  GRANDIOSE IDEAS: People with mania may feel as if they are having high quality skills and seen to be with overly high self-esteem. They may also believe that they are exceptionally gifted by god.

  ALTERED JUDGEMENT: A person may experience difficulty in making decisions while in manic episode. They might say or do stuffs which are out of their character and would never ever otherwise do if they were not suffering from manic episode.

  HALLUCINATIONS: Hallucination is a perceptual experience of seeing or hearing things. They may feel like they heard or sensed something.

  **2. Hypomanic Episode:** Hypomanic episode is a less severe form of mania and might not require critical hospitalization. Though it is not easy to head to manic episode from hypomanic but the features remain the same as those of mania.

  **3. Major depressive episode:** Depression is characterized by a low interest in pleasing activities. While experiencing depressive episode, a person might feel sadness or emptiness in himself/herself.

  **BIPOLAR 1 DISORDER:** In order to be diagnosed with this disorder, the person must experience at least one manic episode along with or without depressive episodes. 

  **BIPOLAR 2 DISORDER:** To get diagnosed with this disorder, the individual experiences at least one episode of major depression and one episode of hypomania which does not turn into mania.

  **CYCLOTHYMIC DISORDER:** To get diagnosed with this kind of disorder, an individual must experience symptoms of depressive episodes and some of the symptoms of hypomania without having full episodes.

  ## **CAUSES OF BIPOLAR DISORDER**

  Bipolar disorder appears from a combination of factors.

  **Genetic factors**: Bipolar disorder is more common in those who have a family member with the condition. A number of [genetic features](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324436) may be involved.

  **Biological traits**: Research suggests that imbalances in neurotransmitters or hormones that affect the brain may play a role.

  **Environmental factors**: Life events, such as abuse, mental [stress](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/145855.php "Why stress happens and how to manage it"), a “significant loss,” or another traumatic event, may trigger an initial episode in a susceptible person

  Bipolar disorder is a relatively common but serious mental health condition that involves changes in mood, energy levels, and attention, alongside other symptoms. It can severely disrupt a person’s life, but treatment can drastically improve the outlook. Treatment may not eliminate mood changes entirely, but working closely with a doctor can make symptoms more manageable and maximize quality of life.
