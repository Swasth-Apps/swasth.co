## **WHAT IS MOOD DISORDER?**

Mood disorders may include depression only (also known as “unipolar depression”) or they may include manic episodes (as in bipolar disorder, which is widely known as “manic depressive illness”). Individuals with mood disorders suffer significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, educational and other important areas of functioning. Individuals with depression feel worthless, sad and empty to the extent that these feelings impair effective functioning. They may also lose interest in their usual activities, experience a change in appetite, suffer from disturbed sleep or have decreased energy. Individuals with mania are overly energetic and may do things that are out of character, such as spending very freely and acquiring debt, breaking the law or showing lack of judgement in sexual behavior. These symptoms are severe and last for several weeks, interfering with relations and social life.

Mood disorders are at times referred to as affective disorder which is a tern that is further classified as depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, and other related disorders. The mood of a person can quickly change from depressed to sad, empty to euphoric, sad to happy and a lot more.

  ## UNDERSTANDING BIPOLAR DISORDER

  Bipolar disorders are common, disabling, recurrent mental health conditions. Onset often occurs in late childhood or early adolescence. Patients with bipolar disorders have higher rates of other mental health disorders and general medical conditions. The term Bipolar disorder means to have dual poles which refers to different emotional states of patients. It is categorized by the experience of changes in moods from extremely high to super low sensation of a particular emotion. These sudden changes in moods can significantly affect the social, mental and personal life of the person suffering from mood swings. Also, it is crucial to take into account that all the individuals suffering from this disorder do not always have the same experience. They are all different in their own ways.  Active management of body weight reduces complications and improves lipid control. Patients and their support systems should be educated about mood relapse, suicidal ideation, and the effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications.
