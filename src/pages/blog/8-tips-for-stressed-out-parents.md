If you happen to be a working parent, then there is a high probability that your to-do list looks like the one above, and it is an endless list of deliverables. As per [the Pew Research Center survey](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/11/04/raising-kids-and-running-a-household-how-working-parents-share-the-load/), most working parents feel tired, stressed, and overwhelmed.

No matter how overwhelmed you feel as a working parent, there are some simple and effective techniques for accomplishing a more competent and calm lifestyle.

*Curious? Check out the list of 8 tips for taming stress-*

## *1.* What is your goal?

![What is your goal?](/img/what-is-your-goal.jpg "What is your goal?")

Working parents who have a clear, compelling view of the future don’t run a directionless race. They are more able to strike-off the commitments from calendars that don’t align with their long term goals. For instance, if your goal is to serve as vice president of the company while raising the kids to be healthy, loved, and financially independent provides a sense of confidence. The goal is achievable, and even on the busiest days, you can have a fixed point on the horizon, and you shall achieve it.

## 2. Learn to Invest your time, Not Spend

As a working parent, when you’re aware of the long term goals, it is then time to invest every day of yours accordingly. Strike off things from your to-do list that sucks your time and energy unnecessarily.

If your goal is to become vice president of the organization and raise kids well, it is essential to go the extra mile. Attend international conferences and take out your kids for an outing on weekends. On the other hand, attending every football game of your first boy and attending every meeting in the city shouldn’t be your priority.

Try spending 10 minutes every weekend to audit your calendar and identify the tasks that don’t fit into your long-term strategy. It is crucial to set boundaries and stick to them. This way, you can better invest your time and achieve satisfaction.

## 3. Plan Everything a Night Before

Now since you’re done organizing tasks a week ahead, it’s time to plan your day a night before for smooth operations. Layout your kids’ clothes, ensure that the homework is finished, mails checked, have some breakfast items prepared such as boiling vegetables, before heading for the next day. Planning little things like knowing where your essentials are, such as car keys, Bluetooth headphones, and glasses will help a productive day.

## 4. Share the Workload with your Spouse

Sharing is caring, whether the matter is of chocolates or home chores. Teamwork eases the load and helps in deriving success. Find out your strengths and weaknesses (of you and your partner) and craft a plan accordingly. For instance, I like to do yoga first thing in the morning and then proceed with other tasks. My husband, on the other hand, likes to work early with a hot cup of tea. He prepares breakfast, and then I come home to finish packing lunches before getting the girls out.

## 5. Take help from your Kids

Now, what if your single parent or maybe you want to see your kids growing as self-dependent adults. Kids lying in the age group of 12-15 should be taught to prepare simple breakfasts like prepare sandwiches, get dressed, finish their homework, pack backpacks, wash their dishes etc. When you teach your kids responsibility and ownership, you give them independence and confidence that would pay in the long run.

## 6. Don’t try to be Perfectionist

Trying to give the best presentation, or prepare the best birthday cake for your little one, or having the best-looking furniture is a far-fetched task. Nobody is perfect, and you shall accept your limitations. Modify your expectations and aim for good enough tasks. This way, you will prevent yourself from bursting away.

## 7. Get in touch with Fellow Parents

Try connecting with the people who are in a similar place like yours. Sometimes, even sharing your stressful feelings and knowing that "you're not alone" helps in destressing. Arrange playdates with their kids, invite them on dinners, and grow your network.

## 8. Know when to Unplug and Enjoy

In the middle of striking a balance between home and work, it is equally important to unplug and take some “Me Time” and “Us Time.” Join Music classes, do meditation, have drinks with your spouse, paint something new, celebrate little successes of your kids, enjoy fun activities, and relish your family's bond.

***Happy Work-Life Balancing!!***
