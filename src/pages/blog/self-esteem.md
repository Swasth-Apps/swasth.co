description: Self-esteem refers to a person's beliefs about their own worth and
  importance. It also involves the feelings people experience that follow from
  their sense of worthiness or unworthiness. Self-esteem is important because it
  heavily influences people's choices and decisions.

## **WHAT IS SELF-ESTEEM?**

Self-esteem in one's value as a human being is a precious psychological resource and generally a highly positive factor in life; it is correlated with achievement, good relationships, and satisfaction. Possessing little self-regard can lead people to become depressed, to fall short of their potential, or to tolerate abusive relationships and situations.

Too much self-love, on the other hand, results in an off-putting sense of entitlement and an inability to learn from failures. It can also be a sign of clinical [](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/narcissism "Psychology Today looks at narcissism")arrogance, in which individuals may behave in a self-centered, arrogant, and manipulative manner. Perhaps no other self-help topic has spawned so much advice and so many (often conflicting) theories.

Self-esteem is an individual's subjective evaluation of their own worth. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame. But self-esteem is not about being too much self-centered or way too much self-lover.

We also have an idea of total self-esteem that refers to the fact that we are as worthy as anyone else. Thus, on one hand we believe that we are dignified which is popularly called Intrinsic worth. This suggests that we must be grateful and humble keeping in mind that all are equal. There is no way that we are going to be successful ignoring the people around or being all arrogant 24/7.
