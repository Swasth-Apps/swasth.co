## **WHAT IS SELF-ESTEEM?**

Self-esteem in one's value as a human being is a precious psychological resource and generally a highly positive factor in life; it is correlated with achievement, good relationships, and satisfaction. Possessing little self-regard can lead people to become depressed, to fall short of their potential, or to tolerate abusive relationships and situations.

Too much self-love, on the other hand, results in an off-putting sense of entitlement and an inability to learn from failures. It can also be a sign of clinical [](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/narcissism "Psychology Today looks at narcissism")arrogance, in which individuals may behave in a self-centered, arrogant, and manipulative manner. Perhaps no other self-help topic has spawned so much advice and so many (often conflicting) theories.

Self-esteem is an individual's subjective evaluation of their own worth. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame. But self-esteem is not about being too much self-centered or way too much self-lover.

We also have an idea of total self-esteem that refers to the fact that we are as worthy as anyone else. Thus, on one hand we believe that we are dignified which is popularly called Intrinsic worth. This suggests that we must be grateful and humble keeping in mind that all are equal. There is no way that we are going to be successful ignoring the people around or being all arrogant 24/7.

## **UNDERSTANDING LOW SELF-ESTEEM**

Self-esteem is the opinion you have of yourself. When you have healthy self-esteem, you tend to think positively about yourself, and optimistically about life in general. When you encounter challenges, you feel confident that you will be up to the task. People with healthy self-esteem know that they are valuable and will be able to name at least some of their positive characteristics such as “I am a good friend”, “I am kind”, “I am honest”, or “I am a good father”.

When you have low self-esteem, you tend to see yourself, the world, and your future more negatively and critically. When you encounter challenges, you doubt whether you will be able to rise to them, and you might avoid them. You might talk to yourself harshly in your mind, such as telling yourself “You’re stupid”, “You’ll never manage this”, or “I don’t amount to anything”. You might feel anxious, sad, low, or unmotivated.

Nobody is born with low self-esteem – it develops as a result of the experiences we have throughout our lives. At the center of low self-esteem are the beliefs and opinions we hold about ourselves. We tell ourselves stories about who we are and form conclusions about ourselves. These opinions can get fixed as thoughts that they are ‘truths’ for all time. In reality, they are just stories or labels, and they don’t capture the full truth of who we are.

## **DEVELOPMENT OF LOW SELF-ESTEEM**

Self-esteem is the factor that defines how we feel about ourselves in a positive manner or negative manner and we form some beliefs about ourselves. Although these beliefs are not formed within seconds, they take a period. The beliefs start growing within ourselves since childhood which may continue till adulthood. Thus, our views about ourselves could be either positive or negative as both of them construct our mind. A few examples of developments of negative beliefs about ourselves could involve the following;

PUNISHMENT, NEGLECTION, ABUSE

Maltreatment, punishment and neglect, abandonment and being abused in various forms leaves deep seated emotional and psychological effects. Development of low self-esteem may also come from the trauma received by parents for a long time. Being bullied or humiliated by colleagues could be another add on.

NOT FITTING AT HOME OR AT SCHOOL

It is quite difficult for a few people to break the standards of ODD ONE OUT for themselves which may cause some serious mental disfunction causing them to acquire low self-esteem and continue the same lifelong.

DIFFICULTY IN MEETING PEER GROUP STANDARDS

This difficulty usually arises during the period of adolescence when our parents or relatives, in fact, even teachers compare us with those students with high standards at anything, be it study, sports, drawing or other activities. Not being able to match their level causes mental trauma.

BEING ON RECEIVING END OF PEOPLE'S STRESS

During childhood most of us experience being on the receiving ends of the frustration of people. People release all their stress on a particular person who seem weak to them. This especially happens in the family when all the family members lash the one out who doesn't speak up. This way the children usually suffer mentally as well as physically.

YOUR FAMILY'S PLACE IN SOCIETY

You are treated accordingly depending upon the status of your family in the society. Assume you are not reach as per others in your locality of relations, you are most likely to get maltreated someway or the other. This treatment of injustice leaves a traumatizing effect on the brain of children which grows into low self-esteem later.

## **TREATMENT OF LOW SELF-ESTEEM**

No one person is less worthy than the next person, and no one is deemed more important. Knowing this detail is crucial. To feel more confident and have healthy self-esteem, it helps to put aside fears of being worth less than others. At the base of  motivational pyramid lies physiological needs, such as the air we breathe and the food we consume. Once those needs are met, it is possible to pursue needs for safety, love and belonging, and self-worth.
