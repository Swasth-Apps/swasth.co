**WHAT IS SELF-COMPASSION?**

*"Through self-compassion beings become more of an inner companion instead of an inner foe".*

![Save yourself](/img/meditate-potrait.jpg "Save yourself")

Self-compassion basically entails treating your inner-self the same way you would treat a friend of yours who is having a hard time even if he/she is just feeling insufficient to take up a task or facing a tough life challenge. We are no stranger to being all king to our family, friends, and relatives. Why not give a try to treating ourselves better? Self-compassion is an exercise in which we learn to befriend our inner selves in. Although we never even look forward to becoming an inner ally, this is what we teach you here in RESILIENS.

**THE THREE ELEMENTS OF SELF-COMPASSION**

**1.*Self-Kindness:*** When we attempt to step forth but fail miserably in some way, we are more likely to either stop attempting newer tasks or block our own track to move ahead. Self-Kindness is all about having a supportive you to keep a broad support shoulder for yourselves. You might have seen generous people that could be you as well, breaking themselves apart in order to save others. Self-kindness counters the tendency to being ignorant towards ourselves.

**2. *Common Humanity:*** An idea of interconnection is core to self-compassion. It is to know that all beings are born flawed and none is perfect without exception, that everyone fails and makes numerous mistakes lifelong. We must know that pain and bruise are a part of life and no one is complete without moments of suffering. The circumstances might be different, the degree of experiencing a particular kind of pain may be different for individuals but the basic experience is still the same.

**3. *Mindfulness:*** Mindfulness incorporates being clear about moment-to-moment practice and experience in a balanced way. It says to be open to assimilating all thoughts, reality of present, and sensation without any limitation.

**WHY IS SELF-COMPASSION IMPORTANT?**

Though it is difficult to mention all the benefits one experiences through self-compassion, we will try our level best to get you familiar with some of its advantages. Let's check them out down in the blog:

1. Evolutionary Importance: We beings have a heavy requirement to be loved. We usually feel that ourselves should be taken care of but we seemingly forget that the same love cannot only be felt by external comfort but by internal too. Why we neglect our own needs and care? Here we teach you how can you show affection towards your inner being which is equally and extremely significant.
2. Self-compassion and psychological well-being: Studies have presented several episodes between self-compassion and mental well-being. Compassion activates the flow of love hormones through blood vessels. This is activated even when the love is directed inwards that is towards oneself. Self-compassion is linked with higher levels of satisfaction, happiness, joy, and a lot more. It is related to emotional intelligence, feelings of social connectedness, optimism which are all necessary to live a joyful and satisfying life.
3. Balancing our emotions: Our emotions are driven by three systems namely threat system, drive system and soothe system.

   1. Threat system: The threat system keeps us on alert as many of us look for potential dangers and consecutively protect ourselves.
   2. Drive system: It comes into effect when we attempt to try something new or head towards our goals. But when we fail, we automatically turn to a threat system.
   3. Soothe system: The system has a relaxing effect on both the above-mentioned systems. It helps to calm us down when the other two systems are overly active.

     Each of these plays their separate roles in balancing our emotions, the elaboration of which you will find on our app.

**HOW CAN YOU CATCH UP?**

It is not even awkward to ask if you can really climb up the hill that we talked about earlier because it is the tendency of a human to feel low of themselves. We oftentimes evaluate ourselves as a non-energetic person but that's not true actually. Criticizing ourselves nonstop can have a negative impact on our mentality of being not worthy enough to tackle something. Practicing self-compassion can surely make you overcome your low self-care and the habit of looking low at yourself. It is for certain tough to enter into the gate of self-compassion though but the endless advantages will surely pull you up to the top. The only you need is to break the taboos and shake hands with the RESILIENS family to fight your way through the troubles.
