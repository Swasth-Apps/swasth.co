**WHAT IS SELF-COMPASSION?**

*"Through self-compassion beings become more of an inner companion instead of an inner foe".*

Self-compassion basically entails treating your inner-self the same way you would treat a friend of yours who is having a hard time even if he/she is just feeling insufficient to take up a task or facing a tough life challenge. We are no stranger to being all king to our family, friends and relatives. Why not give a try to treating ourselves better? Self-compassion is an exercise which we learn to befriend our  inner selves in. Although we never even look forward to becoming an inner ally but this is what we teach you here in RESILIENCE.

**THE THREE ELEMENTS OF SELF-COMPASSION**

**1.*Self-Kindness:*** When we attempt to step forth but fail miserably in some way, we are more likely to either stop attempting newer tasks or block our own track to move ahead. Self-Kindness is all about having a supportive you to keep a broad support shoulder for yourselves. You might have seen generous people that could be you as well, breaking themselves apart in order save others. Self-kindness counters the tendency to being ignorant towards ourselves.

**2. *Common Humanity:*** An idea of interconnection is core to self-compassion. It is to know that all beings are born flawed and none is perfect without exception, that everyone fails and makes numerous mistakes lifelong. We must know that pain and bruise are a part of life and no one is complete without moments of suffering. The circumstances might be different, the degree of experiencing a particular kind of pain may be different for individuals but basic experience is still the same.

**3. *Mindfulness:*** Mindfulness incorporates being clear about moment-to-moment practice and experience in a balanced way. It says to be open to assimilate all thoughts, reality of present , and sensation without any limitation.

**HOW CAN YOU CATCH UP?**

It is not even awkward to ask if you can really climb up the hill that we talked about earlier because it is the tendency of human to feel low of himself. We oftentimes evaluate ourselves as a lowly energetic person but that's not true actually. Criticizing ourselves nonstop can have a negative impact on our mentality of being not worthy enough to tackle something. Practicing self-compassion can surely make you overcome your low self-care and the habit of looking low at yourself.
