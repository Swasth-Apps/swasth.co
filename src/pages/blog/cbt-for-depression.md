## **WHAT IS CBT?**

CBT is a form of psychological treatment that has been found to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol, and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness. Various research studies suggest that CBT leads to significant improvement in functioning and quality of life. In many studies, CBT has been seen to be as effective as, or more effective than, other forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric medications.

It is important to emphasize that advances in CBT have been made on the basis of both research and clinical practice. Indeed, CBT is an approach for which there is adequate scientific evidence that the methods that have been developed actually produce change. In this manner, CBT differs from many other forms of psychological treatment.

## **UNDERSTANDING DEPRESSION**

![](static/img/depressed3.jpeg)

Do you often find yourself struggling to find peace or happiness? Do you do the activities that you would enjoy feel not so enjoyable? You might have spent ample time finding out the real reason behind your change in activities but sadly you couldn't. Right? You only yourself all engrossed in negative thoughts instead. There is a high chance that you are probably suffering from depression. But, WAIT UP!

This is the optimum place where you have eventually landed. So, do not panic and work along.

Basically, depression consists of a clinical condition that includes a number of symptoms, both psychological and physical. Some of these symptoms are:

* Persistent low mood
* Little to no interest in the things that we have previously enjoyed
* Uncharacteristically decreased or increased appetite
* Consistent fatigue or lack of energy
* Poor sleep (insomnia) or sleeping too much (hypersomnia)
* Reduced ability to concentrate
* Consistent feelings of guilt or worthlessness
* Feelings of restlessness or a reduction of physical movement
* Recurrent thoughts of death, sometimes including suicidal plans or urge

But depression varies from simple sadness which naturally occurs to long-lasting triggers. But most commonly, depression persists for a long period of time.

## **WHY AM I DEPRESSED?**

Depression has never been a choice but it just comes by itself. It comes with a train of emotions and frequent mood swings that often require counseling. It is believed that depression symbolizes a combination of biology, environment, and personality, and the way we look at a situation or trigger tends to carve our emotional response. We are aware of the feelings and thoughts that reside in our subconscious, but once we are supposed to pay attention to them.

* **Abuse.** Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can make you more vulnerable to depression later in life.
* **Age.** People who are elderly are at higher risk of depression. That can be made worse by other factors, such as living alone and having a lack of social support.
* **Certain medications.** Some drugs, such as isotretinoin (used to treat acne), the antiviral drug interferon-alpha, and corticosteroids, can increase your risk of depression.
* **Conflict.** Depression in someone who has the biological vulnerability to it may result from personal conflicts or disputes with family members or friends.
* **Death or a loss.** Sadness or grief after the death or loss of a loved one, though natural, can increase the risk of depression.
* **Gender.** Women are about twice as likely as men to become depressed. No one's sure why. The hormonal changes that women go through at different times of their lives may play a role

## **CBT VS. OTHER TREATMENT APPROACHES**

CBT is the therapy that combats depression in all ways. CBT focuses on the relationships among our thoughts, emotions, and actions. In its actual form, it shows how modifying the thoughts can help you overcome depression. Some of the benefits of using CBT over other methods could be as follows:

1. CBT is based on the concept that our thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and actions are interlinked, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle.
2. CBT aims to help you deal with overwhelming problems in a positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.
3. You're shown how to change these negative patterns to improve the way you feel about particular things.
4. Unlike some other talking treatments, CBT deals with your current problems, rather than focusing on issues from your past, which helps you as a back-support.
5. It looks for practical ways to improve your state of mind.
