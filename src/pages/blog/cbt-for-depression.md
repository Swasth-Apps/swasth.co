## **WHAT IS CBT?**

CBT is a form of psychological treatment that has been found to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders and severe mental illness. Various research studies suggest that CBT leads to significant improvement in functioning and quality of life. In many studies, CBT has been seen to be as effective as, or more effective than, other forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric medications.

It is important to emphasize that advances in CBT have been made on the basis of both research and clinical practice. Indeed, CBT is an approach for which there is adequate scientific evidence that the methods that have been developed actually produce change. In this manner, CBT differs from many other forms of psychological treatment.

## **UNDERSTANDING DEPRESSION**

Do you often find yourself struggling to find peace or happiness? Do the activities that you would enjoy feel like not so enjoyable? You might have spent ample time in finding out the real reason behind your change in activities but sadly you couldn't. Right? You only yourself all engrossed in negative thoughts instead. There is a high chance that you are probably suffering from depression. But, WAIT UP!

This is the optimum place where you have eventually landed. So, do not panic and work along.

Basically, depression consists of a clinical condition that includes a number of symptoms, both psychological and physical. Some of these symptoms are:

* Persistent low mood
* Little to no interest in the things that we have previously enjoyed
* Uncharacteristically decreased or increased appetite
* Consistent fatigue or lack of energy
* Poor sleep (insomnia) or sleeping too much (hypersomnia)
* Reduced ability to concentrate
* Consistent feelings of guilt or worthlessness
* Feelings of restlessness or a reduction of physical movement
* Recurrent thoughts of death, sometimes including suicidal plans or urges

But depression varies from simple sadness which is naturally occurs to long lasting triggers. But most commonly, depression persists for a long period of time.

## **WHY AM I DEPRESSED?**

Depression has never been a choice but it just comes by itself. It comes with a train of emotions and frequent mood swings that often requires counseling. It is believed  that depression symbolizes a combination of biology, environment, and personality, and the way we look at a situation or trigger tends to carve our emotional response. We are aware of the feelings and thoughts that reside in our subconscious, but once we are supposed to pay attention to them.

* **Abuse.** Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can make you more vulnerable to depression later in life.
* **Age.** People who are elderly are at higher risk of depression. That can be made worse by other factors, such as living alone and having a lack of social support.
* **Certain [medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx).** Some drugs, such as [isotretinoin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6662/isotretinoin+oral/details) (used to treat [acne](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/default.htm)), the antiviral drug [interferon](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-37/interferon+alfa-2b+injection/details)-alpha, and corticosteroids, can increase your risk of depression.
* **Conflict.** Depression in someone who has the biological vulnerability to it may result from personal conflicts or disputes with family members or friends.
* **Death or a loss.** Sadness or [grief](https://www.webmd.com/balance/normal-grieving-and-stages-of-grief) after the death or loss of a loved one, though natural, can increase the risk of depression.
* **Gender.** Women are about twice as likely as men to become depressed. No one's sure why. The hormonal changes that women go through at different times of their lives may play a role

## **CBT VS. OTHER TREATMENT APPROACHES**

CBT is the therapy that combats depression through all the ways. CBT focuses on the relation among our thoughts, emotions and actions. In its actual form, it shows how modifying the thoughts can help you overcome depression.
