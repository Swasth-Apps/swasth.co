# What is IBS?

IBS is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. Functional GI disorders, which doctors now call disorders of gut-brain interactions, are related to problems with how your brain and your gut work together. These problems can cause your gut to be more sensitive and change how the muscles in your bowel contract. If your gut is more sensitive, you may feel more abdominal pain and bloat. Changes in how the muscles in your bowel contract lead to diarrhea, constipation, or both.

Some of the symptoms of IBS could be as follows:

* Abdominal pain for at least three months. It can be present continuously, but more often it is intermittent (on and off over time). The pain is relieved with a bowel movement. 
* Increased frequency of bowel movements when the pain occurs. Alternatively, infrequent bowel movements (constipation) may be experienced at other times.
* Increased looseness of the stool when abdominal pain is felt. At other times, the stool form may be hard or constipated. 
* Mucus in the stool. 
* A sensation of incomplete emptying of the rectum after going to the bathroom. 
* A bloated or distended feeling in the abdomen.

  Pain is the most dominant symptom of IBS. Individuals with IBS may either have mostly diarrhea, mostly constipation, or both diarrhea and constipation. Apart from this, some other symptoms may also be associated with lBS. However, they cannot be used to diagnose the condition. Some of these are:

  * Urinary problems
  * Migraine headaches
  * Painful sexual intercourse
  * Fatigue
  * Heartburn
  * Fibromyalgia (a disorder that causes chronic muscle pain, fatigue, memory problems, and other symptoms.)

  # Causes of IBS

  **Genetic contributors**

  The findings are indicative of an underlying genetic basis for IBS. Although IBS appears to run in families, the previously cited studies suggest that there may be individuals with “sporadic” or non-familial IBS as well as individuals with a familial form of IBS.

  **Hypersensitive gut**

  One theory suggests that people with irritable bowel may have increased perception of normal day-to-day activities such as food digestion. They probably have greater intestinal awareness. This implies that normal gut stimulation may result in abnormal overreactions such as pain.

  **Infection connection**

  Almost 30% of those with infections involving diarrhea may have irritable bowel later. IBS symptoms may exist for years after the infection and may gradually fade after few months.

  **Bacteria**

   It is possible that alteration in a particular type of bacteria or a number of bacteria contributeS to IBS symptoms.

  **Brain-gut connection**

  The altered patterns of colonic motility and sensation appear to be due to disruptions in the communication between the brain and gut.

  **Physical and sexual abuse**

   People with IBS are more likely to have experienced physical or sexual abuse as a child. Such traumatic life events and other such psychosocial factors may be one of the factors to play such a heavy role in acquiring IBS.

  # Risk factors and complications

  There are certain factors that make a person more likely to suffer from IBS. These risk factors include:

  * Females are twice more likely as men to experience IBS symptoms. The reason isn’t clear, however, it has been suggested that this may be due to changing hormones during the menstrual cycle.
  * Those who are below the age of 40 are more likely to experience this.
  * Family history is another factor that may increase the likelihood of IBS. This condition seems to run in families.
  * Emotional distress or early life trauma also increases the chances of having this condition. Although stress and IBS are related which comes first is not yet clear.

     Those with IBS are thrice more likely to miss work as compared to those without bowel problems.

    # TREATMENT FOR IBS

    ![](static/img/limitations-of-cft.png)

    The success of the treatment often depends on having a good understanding of what IBS is and how it is treated. Let's see some of these treatments as given below:

    **Medications** 

    People with IBS are likely to receive some form of drug treatment to deal with their symptoms. Some of the most common given are:

    * Antispasmodics 
    * Anti-diarrheal agents 
    * Laxatives 
    *  Anti-anxiety medications

      **Probiotic and Antibiotics**

    A number of bacteria exist in our gut and digestive tract. Research has shown that certain probiotics are helpful in treating symptoms of IBS. Further, certain bad bacteria are also related to IBS symptoms in few people.

    **\
    Psychotherapy**

    A number of therapies have been found to be helpful in treating IBS. They include:

    * Cognitive Behavioral  Therapy (CBT)

    CBT is a promising technique that has been increasingly found to be effective in dealing with non-organic problems. CBT model for IBS suggests that a number of predisposing factors such as maladaptive beliefs about illnesses fear reaction to food items aggravate IBS fear and avoidance behaviors. 

    * Hypnotherapy

    There is good evidence that so-called gut-directed hypnotherapy is efficacious in the treatment of IBS. In gut-directed hypnotherapy, hypnosis is induced which suggestions are made for peace and warmth spreading from hand to abdomen. This may be accompanied by relaxing mental images.

    * Complementary therapies

    This involves Chinese herbal therapy, acupuncture, acupressure, yoga, etc. Increasingly these therapies are being used by those with IBS in addition to other therapies or as an alternative therapy. Herbal infusions have been said to be helpful to deal with various symptoms.
