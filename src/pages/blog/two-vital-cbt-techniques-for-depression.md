“I am viceroy of this country. I am a mother of 12 children. I conceived my first child in my mother’s womb. My parents, with whom I am living, are not my real parents.” and many more such statements were given by a 21 years aged girl, Mary. At times she started crying with no reason, and in certain instances, she was found talking in the air. Laughing, crying, screaming within herself was her lifestyle when I met her in a gathering. Later, I came to know that she was a depression patient.

## Depression

Depression is a state of mind when a person starts living in his own imaginary world, which has nothing to take with reality. In medical terminology, it is a type of mental distortion or illness. While in depression, a person inculcates the feeling of helplessness, sadness, failure, left out, and such similar unhealthy thoughts.

## CBT For Depression

In order to treat depression, Cognitive Behavior Therapy has been proved to be the most powerful tool. This therapy works on the principle of cognition i.e., the mind processes. CBT comprises various talk sessions where the patient's thoughts and feelings are heard, evaluated, and modified after that according to the things actually are.

Let us understand CBT for depression in an easier way - the behavior of a person is what his thoughts are. And the thoughts are what the feelings reflect. Now for a person in depression, his unhelpful behavior is generated by faulty thoughts. Distorted feelings are the foundation for these erroneous thoughts. So, to treat a depressed person, one must transform his emotions to alter the patient's thoughts. Ultimately, his behavior can be normalized.

The main thing to behold while providing CBT for depression is that the psychological twist must be applied to the patient when he is calm. Else his powerful emotions would not accept these changes rather would counterattack, and the situation may become even worse. Also, the therapist must work with the patient's feelings so that he readily accepts the changes that a psychotherapist wants to bring.

Hope is one of the most effective antidepressants ever encountered. Hope works as an antidote to depression, which is arisen in the patient by Cognitive Behavior Therapy. The two vital CBT techniques used for depression are:

### 1. Reframing The Patient’s Thoughts

####    (Affecting the subconscious level)

<!--StartFragment-->

In the first technique, the patient is heard patiently and minutely. The way he explains his thoughts, expresses his feelings, every vital thing that he wants to convey. One must simultaneously keep reflecting back to the patient in exactly the same manner, as he is portraying his feelings. This reflection should be made in a subtle manner and in a reformed way.

Any positive words will uplift the patient's morale and would help him get out of the zone easily. At everything he conveys, we can nod our head as if we fully agree with him. This very feel in the patient would let us enter his distorted emotional zone, making him comfortable in sharing his thoughts.

Avoid using the monitoring words like, you must, you should have, no you are mistaken, etc. This would work like kerosene in the fire of emotions of the patient, the things would adopt a wrong path. The reason behind this being, the person in depression considers all his thoughts to be brutal that keeps digging the negativity deeper. As a result, the patient develops it as a strong belief of his life.

While reflecting back his feelings, we can add pleasing words like, perhaps, maybe, you might be thinking right and so on. The use of such words would maintain the patient in his comfort zone, but simultaneously impart an impact on his subconscious mind and will help him reframe his thoughts. Like I did with Mary.

When she said, “I am viceroy of this country.” I replied, “ Wow that’s great, at what age did you become the viceroy?”

When she said, “I am a mother of 12 children.” My response was, “ That’s great. No one could predict this as you are still maintained.”

Her words, “I conceived my first child in my mother’s womb” gave me a big shock. But I calmly responded, “It is no less than magic.”

For her complaint, “My parents, with whom I am living, are not my real parents” I said, “Still they love you so much that no one can make this out.”

This conversation landed Mary to two - ways of satisfaction. One, there is someone to listen to and understand her. And second, the unconscious impact that she took for each of her statements. Her happiness in sharing her feelings with me made her relaxed and calm at her mind.

Now when Mary was calm, it was the turn of application of the second CBT technique for depression.

### 2. Depression Pattern Analysis By Patient

#### (Working at a conscious level of mind)

<!--StartFragment-->

After the feeling or the bond of comfort and trust is developed between us and the patient, we just have to take our next step of working at his conscious level.

We should take things as they come. We have to think according to the perspective of the patient, what he wants to show us. We will have to accept that whatever the sufferer is saying is correct. Once we have brought our thinking level up to the level of the patient, that would be the point from where we would be able to introduce our thoughts into his mind. It will then be the commencement of paving the way out of the depression world for the patient.

We should then start making the patient analyze as to what type of thought pattern was he developing or feeling. And as the patient is in the condition to make it out, it would be the moment for him to return back to the real world.

Before CBT for depression is given to a patient, we must take into account hemorrhage if any that he might have encountered. Also, his schedule must be monitored thoroughly.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy may have to be repeated every five to ten months, depending upon the severity of the case. But the results of CBT for depression have always been found to be positive.
