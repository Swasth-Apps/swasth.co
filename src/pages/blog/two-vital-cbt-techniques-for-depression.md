“I am viceroy of this country. I am a mother of 12 children. I conceived my first child in my mother’s womb. My parents, with whom I am living, are not my real parents.” and many more such statements were given by a 21 years aged girl, Mary. At times she started crying with no reason, and in certain instances, she was found talking in the air. Laughing, crying, screaming within herself was her lifestyle when I met her in a gathering. Later, I came to know that she was a depression patient.

## Depression

Depression is a state of mind when a person starts living in his own imaginary world, which has nothing to take with reality. In medical terminology, it is a type of mental distortion or illness. While in depression, a person inculcates the feeling of helplessness, sadness, failure, left out, and such similar unhealthy thoughts.

## CBT For Depression

In order to treat depression, Cognitive Behavior Therapy has been proved to be the most powerful tool. This therapy works on the principle of cognition i.e., the mind processes. CBT comprises various talk sessions where the patient's thoughts and feelings are heard, evaluated, and modified after that according to the things actually are.

Let us understand CBT for depression in an easier way - the behavior of a person is what his thoughts are. And the thoughts are what the feelings reflect. Now for a person in depression, his unhelpful behavior is generated by faulty thoughts. Distorted feelings are the foundation for these erroneous thoughts. So, to treat a depressed person, one must transform his emotions to alter the patient's thoughts. Ultimately, his behavior can be normalized.

The main thing to behold while providing CBT for depression is that the psychological twist must be applied to the patient when he is calm. Else his powerful emotions would not accept these changes rather would counterattack, and the situation may become even worse. Also, the therapist must work with the patient's feelings so that he readily accepts the changes that a psychotherapist wants to bring.

Hope is one of the most effective antidepressants ever encountered. Hope works as an antidote to depression, which is arisen in the patient by Cognitive Behavior Therapy. The two vital CBT techniques used for depression are:

### 1. Reframing The Patient’s Thoughts

#### \    (Affecting the subconscious level)

In the first technique, the patient is heard patiently and minutely. The way he explains his thoughts, expresses his feelings, every vital thing that he wants to convey. The therapist must simultaneously keep reflecting on the patient accurately as he is portraying his emotions. This reflection must be made in a subtle manner and in a reformed way.

The patient must get positive feedback as if he is properly being understood. At everything he conveys, you must nod your head as if you fully agree with him. This very feel in the patient would let you enter his distorted emotional zone, making him comfortable in sharing his thoughts.

Avoid using the monitoring words as you must, you should have, no, you are mistaken, etc. This would work like kerosene in the fire of the patient's emotions, and the things would adopt a wrong path. The reason behind this being, the person in depression, considers all his thoughts to be brutal that keeps digging the negativity deeper. As a result, the patient develops it as a strong belief in his life.

While reflecting on his feelings, you can add pleasing words like: perhaps, you might be thinking right and so on. The use of such terms would maintain the patient in his comfort zone, but simultaneously impact his subconscious mind and help him reframe his thoughts. Like I did with Mary.

When she said, "I am viceroy of this country." I replied, "Wow, that's great, at what age did you become the viceroy?"

When she said, "I am a mother of 12 children." My response was, "That's great. No one could predict this as you are still maintained."

Her words, "I conceived my first child in my mother's womb," gave me a big shock. But I calmly responded, "It is no less than magic."

For her complaint, "My parents, with whom I am living, are not my real parents," I said, "Still, they love you so much that no one can make this out."

This conversation landed Mary to two - ways of satisfaction. One, there is someone to listen to and understand her. And second, the unconscious impact that she took for each of her statements. Her happiness in sharing her feelings with me made her relaxed and calm in her mind.

Now when Mary was calm, it was the turn of application of the second CBT technique for depression.

### 2. Depression Pattern Analysis By Patient

#### (Working at a conscious level of mind)

After the feeling or the bond of comfort and trust is developed between you and the patient, you just have to take your next step of working at his conscious level.

Take the things as they come to you. You have to think according to the perspective of the patient, what he wants to show you. You will have to accept that whatever your patient is saying is correct. Once you have brought your thinking level up to your patient's level, that would be the point from which you would be able to introduce your thoughts into his mind. It will then be the commencement of paving the way out of the depression world for your patient.

You should then start making your patient analyze what type of thought pattern he was developing or feeling. And as the patient is in the condition to make it out, it would be the moment for him to return back to the real world.

Before you start giving CBT for depression to a patient, you must take into account hemorrhage, if any, that he might have encountered. Also, his schedule must be monitored.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy may have to be repeated every five to ten months, depending upon the severity of the case. But the results of CBT for depression have always been found to be positive.
