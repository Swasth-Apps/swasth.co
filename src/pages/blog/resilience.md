## Five strategies for Developing Resilience Skills

### 1. Practice Acceptance

Reality can be painful, and the idea of embracing it may look terrifying. However, the truth is denying its existence will not change anything. The reality will continue to be there for you to deal with it. Therefore, the best way to cope with such painful situations is to open yourself up to the present moment with no judgment or fury and to see the reality with acceptance. Acceptance is not merely a thought or idea, it's a comprehensive practice that involves various tenets to keep in mind.

* Accept yourself and your life for what you are, not for what you think it should be like.
* Understand and acknowledge what is in your hand and what's not.
* Analyze yourself and your life events without judgment or criticism.
* Acknowledge the reality of yourself.
* Practice mindfulness and be effective in your actions.

### 2. Regain Personal Control

Adversities may cause you to undermine your abilities and reduce your self-confidence. For example, if a bad review at work stresses you out, and you begin to think that you are destined to fail, it can lead to dangerous behavioral outcomes. The remedy is to focus on the factors you can control and remind yourself that you are responsible for your actions, and you have the sole power to change things where they are headed.

### 3. Invest in a new goal

Once you've regained your self-control, it's time to identify and address new opportunities and plan how you can grow personally and establish yourself professionally in your next session. Imagine having a distressing situation, post your emotional turmoil, it's essential to reflect on what went wrong, and figure out your areas of improvement so that you can set new goals as your next step.

A new goal could be related to proactively addressing your setback, such as acquiring a professional skill, searching for a new job, going on dates, or repairing your stained relationships. You might also pursue a goal that adds a new meaning or sense of joy to your life, like a hobby or age-old interest that you haven't flipped the pages of in a while.

### 4. Think Optimistically

While overcoming adversities and attaining new goals, your attitude towards life matters. An optimistic approach is an essential tool for reinforcing positive emotions and buffering mental health symptoms. Once you begin this practice, you can witness several beneficial outcomes in the long-run, such as improved physical health, increased productivity levels, and so on.

### 5. Seek Support

Once you endure adversities, it's obvious to be intimidated by the future, or be overpowered by feelings of isolation or neglect. That's why it's so important to reach out. Ensure support from people you're close to or those who understand your complex situations, without oversimplifying your complexities and giving you positive hopes for the future. In case you do not find anyone reliable, or support from your friends and family don't work, you can also seek therapeutic support from trained psychologists around you. This will not only help you develop resilience skills but also allow you to eliminate stress-causing elements.
