## **WHAT IS POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY?**

Positive psychology is a kind of psychology describing the traits of strengths and behavior which motivates the individuals to live a meaningful life. Studies show that this area seeks to know the factors of a happening life. Positive psychology puts emphasis on the concept of true meaning of satisfaction, and this field discovered the involvement of different types of positive living, including positive emotions, flow states and a sense of richness.

Positive psychology is pretty different from from other branches of psychology as it focuses more on well being rather than just revolving around causes. Because of its interest in positivity, it helps us stay away from negative mindsets and problematic ideas. Knowing the characteristics and strengths such as honesty or justice, is considered to be a crucial move in the direction of healthy lifestyle. Positive psychology has its eyes fixed on positive experiences and influences in your life. These include happiness, love, inspiration and positive behavior.

A few of the topics that help us know positive psychology in the way it is supposed to be learnt are:

Strengths and weaknesses

life satisfaction

Happiness

wellbeing

Gratitude

Compassion

Hope

Optimism

These topics help us understand how we can modify our day to day life to construct the optimum version of ourselves. Assessing these topics help us know certain practices grounded in positive psychology. People who are into flourishing themselves and their surrounding can count these factors in and strive to achieve a peaceful state of mind.

## **ADVANTAGES OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY**

The pros of positive psychology without any doubt, includes an improvement in self-esteem and self-confidence, interpersonal relationships, and a broader outlook of life. Practicing the factors related to positive psychology such as gratitude can enhance social and mental happiness. Positive psychology also helps in exploring factors like hope, strengths, positivity as well as a good sense of what life actually is. Some of the other potential benefits could be:

* Improved sense of justice
* Change in perspective
* Greater self-esteem
* Improved relationships
* Higher productivity
* Better Concentration
* Proper work-life balance
* Greater success

## **NEGATIVITY BIAS AND WAYS TO OVERCOME IT**

Do you perhaps feel uneasy thinking about unpleasing events of your life? Or, do you feel like forcing yourself to go for triggering or negative articles?  Since we are all humans and it is not strange to think like that at some point of time in our life. But sometimes we get too affected by such events that they start threatening us all the time. This negativity bias can affect how we behave, perceive, or think. Negativity bias refers to " pay attention to, learn from, and apply negative information way more than the positive one". 

Apart from these elements, this negativity bias can also help us know why we usually:

* Remember and think about insults more than compliments
* Behave more emotionally and physically and respond more to aversive stimuli
* Dwell on unpleasant or traumatic occurrences more than pleasant ones
* Pay our attention faster on negative rather than positive things.

Although it has many positive effects in our life, but negativity bias can cause us to emphasize purely bad thing that ever happened. It can get us count on uncomfortable past that had some bad effects on our mind, and we start bothering ourselves thinking of negative events. It also lead our way to a few aspects of life. By turning our attention more towards positive events and feelings, we begin focusing on distortion of negativity bias but it requires regular practice. 

Such practices involve,

**Focusing on the present and Avoiding Negative Self-Talk**

**Mindfulness and Meditation**

**Relish the Positive Moments**

## **HEALING WITH POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY**

In the therapy, there is a shift of focus from body and pain to a clear emphasis on thoughts, strengths and inspiration. The medical experts do not seem to assess the health of the client, they rather focus their attention on how to make the patient use his/her strength to a good extent.

Practitioners recognize the perspective of the clients and try to turn them into reality. The idea is based on recognition of positive aspects, and emotions of individuals. The goal of such a treatment is to get you live your life with all your strength rather than simply lingering around painful events.

Positive Psychology explains that unpleasing events should be forgotten and one should focus more on how to cope with fear, stress, sadness, anxiety and hatred. On the other side, positivity helps us live happily with joy, gratitude, hope and desire.
