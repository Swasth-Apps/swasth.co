## Mental Health Landscape

Workplace stress is a common problem in the US. According to [IPSOS](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/mental-health-survey-2017), more than 28% of Americans attributed their mental health problems to workplace stress.

Workplace conflicts can be tackled with help, and work stress can be reduced with definite treatments. Still, if either of them is left unchecked for long, it can lead to more significant problems like depression, anxiety, and dysfunctional behaviors. More than[300 million people](http://www.who.int/mental_health/in_the_workplace/en/) in the world suffer from depression, and this condition is the prime reason why employees have a disability and other underlying issues.

The biggest drawback of workplace stress is that it doesn't stay confined to work; it affects people's mental health and relationships, attacks their productivity level, and decreases their confidence level. According to the [Anxiety and Depression Association of America reports, 83% of men and 72%](https://adaa.org/workplace-stress-anxiety-disorders-survey)[of women](https://adaa.org/workplace-stress-anxiety-disorders-survey) state that workplace stress affects their personal lives like relationships with spouses or children. While it's challenging to manage stress at work, preparing yourself with evidence-based coping mechanisms can go a long way. This guide provides leading reasons for mental health problems at work and tips on coping with them for a healthy and meaningful life.

## Factors that cause Mental Health Problems at Work

<!--StartFragment-->

Workplace stress can have multiple origins or may emerge from one aspect of an employer's roles and responsibilities. And its effects are severe and extensive. Factors like downsizing, layoffs, and bankruptcies are common occurrences in industries and can change the lives of thousands of workers. Therefore, greater responsibilities, pay cuts, lower benefits, and many other factors could be the underlying reasons for workplace stress. Here is a list of elements that causes workplace stress among people:

### 1. Inflexible work schedules

Lack of flexible work schedules make workers helpless and often powerless. They usually do not get enough time to invest in their personal lives, which further deteriorates their mental health, affecting their overall productivity.

### 2. Lack of support from management

Another major factor that causes workplace stress is lack of support and mismanagement. When a workplace lacks open-gate policy and employers are not included in decision-making processes, they don't feel supported by their employers or coworkers. As a result, this can increase their work-load and catalyze their existing work stress.

### 3. Lack of clarity about tasks

When employees are assigned tasks, the way it's done can make a lot of difference. If there is a lack of proper guidance or communication, workers get susceptible to heavy load, unnecessary routine tasks, and greater responsibilities. This breaks their morale down and gives them an overview of a problematic workplace environment.

### 4. Work culture

Most workplace stress causes are emotional. Factors like rude employers, inconsiderate coworkers, inadequate privacy systems, and harassment indicate lousy work culture, which can be significant reasons for workplace stress, anxiety, and even depression.

## **How to improve Mental Health at Work?**

<!--EndFragment--><!--StartFragment-->

Keeping in mind the amount of time people invest in their jobs daily, they need to navigate workplace stress and address mental health issues, if any, instead of displaying neglect. The following steps can help you alleviate workplace stress for an overall improvement of mental and physical health.

### 1. Organize your workspace

Taking control of your regular tasks and work environment can prevent you from overwhelming emotions and stressful thoughts, at ease. Before you start working, take out some in arranging your place, tidy up the papers, throw away unnecessary items, and open a window to let some fresh air come in. When it comes to your routine, make a list of what's in your control and what's not. Manage your time efficiently and ensure as much clarity as you can with your schedule.

### 2. Step outside

Nature has healing properties like no other. When in too much pressure or stress, step outside and enjoy the greenery around you.

A [study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204611003665) led by the University of Edinburgh reported that people's stress levels are directly proportional to the amount of greenery present in their area. The psychologists also discovered that for every 1% increase in green space around them, there was a corresponding reduction in people's stress levels.

### 3. Tune in to distractions

According to DBTpsychologists, mindfulness is a crucial tool implemented to reduce stress. Distractions can be hard to cope with, but ultimately trying to block it out, such as not paying attention to a fun conversation happening at your next desk or your colleague calling your name from the other side, can lead to more significant stress. Therefore, it's advised to pay attention to your surroundings and observe its effect on your body, as you tune in to your distractions.

### 4. Avoid Workplace Gossip

<!--StartFragment-->

Some people use "gossip" as a source of entertainment and seek temporary relief from extensive work pressure. In the long run, it can lead to reduced morale and strained relationships among coworkers. Discussing problems with a colleague can be helpful, but it's healthy only when it's done with the specific person, devoid of third parties.
