If you're looking for the best-suited therapy for yourself, you might've already noticed the myriad of its types available. Although some therapeutic models work best for specific conditions, others can help with a vast range of underlying issues.

In therapy, you'll have to collaborate with a trained mental health professional. The activities you have to perform in each appointment depends on your preferred method of treatment and the issues you're looking to address.

You can expect to have an impactful discussion on challenging circumstances, vulnerable emotions, and dysfunctional behaviors that affect your life.

This will likely involve working up your way towards addressing negative events or distressing thoughts. All these may sound difficult in the beginning, but the end result is usually a happier and more meaningful life.

Here's a look at some common types of therapy and how to choose which one is best for you:

## Psychodynamic therapy

Psychodynamic therapy developed from psychoanalysis is a long-term mental health treatment that comprises unravelling your thought patterns and behavior that contribute to distressing emotions. This is an extensive therapy approach where the patient can talk about anything they like- about childhood and past, recurring dreams and even fantasies.

### How does it work?

In Psychodynamic Therapy, you'll work with a therapist to decipher the link between your unconscious mind and your actions. This involves examining your emotions, relationships, and thought patterns.

Psychodynamic Therapy can be a longer-term approach to mental health treatment, compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other types of therapy. It can even go for years. Several surveys and researches determine that people continue to see positive results, even after they have stopped taking the therapy a long time back.

### What is it Good for?

Psychodynamic Therapy may be a good choice for addressing:

* depression
* anxiety
* eating disorders
* sleeping disorders
* substance abuse

  ## Behavioral Therapy<!--StartFragment-->

  Unlike other normative therapies, Behavioral Therapy is an effective, action-oriented mental health treatment program.

  According to behavioral theorists, certain behaviors emerge from what you have learnt in your past and some of these behaviors might affect your mind negatively, thereby causing distress. In Behavioral Therapy, you can change your behavioral responses with the help of various tools available.

  ### How does it work?

  In Behavioral Therapy, you won't spend much time reflecting on subconscious feelings that are responsible for your behavior and emotional difficulties.

  Instead, you'll learn ways to change behavioral patterns that cause distress.

  There are many subtypes of Behavioral Therapy, including:

  * **Systematic Desensitization**: It is a combination of relaxation exercises and exposure to your triggers. This approach is effective in helping you replace feelings of fear and anxiety with a more appropriate relaxed reaction.
  * **Aversion Therapy**: In aversion Therapy, you learn to associate the behavior you want to change with something that's uncomfortable or unpleasant to you.
  * **Flooding**: This is similar to systematic desensitization, but it involves confronting your fears directly from the very beginning, rather than going over it, gradually. If you have hydrophobia, for example, the first exposure step might be an attempt to jump into a swimming pool. With systematic desensitization, on the other hand, your first exposure step might be dipping your feet into a pool of water.

  ### What is it Good for?

  Behavioral Therapy may be a good option for addressing:

  * anxiety
  * phobias
  * hyperactivity disorder
  * obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
  * interpersonal ineffectiveness

    ## Humanistic Therapy

    Humanistic Therapy is an approach that focuses on your surroundings that cause distress - for example, at times, our invalidating environment, e.g. family members or colleagues, tend to oversimplify our complex emotions, which can further lead to an escalation of our distress. It teaches people to believe in their capabilities of understanding themselves in the best way.

    Humanistic therapists work to help you better understand your experiences and emotions without interpreting your feelings for you.

    ## How does it work?

    Your therapist will help you work toward the goal of living your best life, largely by enabling you to be in your original self. You'll spend time finding ways to develop and increase self-acceptance along with adapting commitment towards betterment.

    ### What is it Good for?

    Humanistic Therapy can be useful for addressing:

    * self-esteem issues
    * difficulty accepting chronic health concerns
    * Post Traumatic stress disorder
    * depression
    * relationship issues
    * substance abuse
    * feelings of worthlessness or self-judgment

      The vast majority of therapeutic approaches do not apply to just one mental health issue. They can be used for treating various other mental health concerns, either individually or combining two or more therapies. For example, Psychotherapists can use a treatment program to address depression, but there is no "Depression Therapy." Nonetheless, there are some types of psychotherapies available that are specifically effective for specific issues and illnesses. Once you figure out which is the best fit for you, you can easily find help in improving your mental health and overall lifestyle.
