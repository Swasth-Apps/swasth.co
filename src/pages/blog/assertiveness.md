description: Assertiveness is a skill regularly referred to in social and
  communication skills training. Being assertive means being able to stand up
  for your own or other people's rights in a calm and positive way, without
  being either aggressive, or passively accepting 'wrong'. It is the ability to
  take responsibilities for your actions without being judgmental unnecessarily,
  and being self-assured.
