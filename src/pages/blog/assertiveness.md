description: Assertiveness is a skill regularly referred to in social and
  communication skills training. Being assertive means being able to stand up
  for your own or other people's rights in a calm and positive way, without
  being either aggressive, or passively accepting 'wrong'. It is the ability to
  take responsibilities for your actions without being unnecessarily judgmental,
  and being self-assured.

## **UNDERSTANDING ASSERTIVENESS**

Most of the people have  misunderstand assertiveness and only a handful of them have a good grip over its actual facts. So, the question that arises now is: What assertiveness truly means? We find a number of mentioned quotes in literatures and write-ups which explain about the true meaning of assertiveness. We may call it as an ability to express both, positive and negative thoughts in addition to feelings in an honest and straight way. Also, it is the ability to stand for your actions and compromise in situations where there are chances of occurrence of conflicts and disputes.

Although it is usually thought that assertiveness is all about getting your own way while it is actually not. The quality of assertiveness offers a variety of benefits as follows:

It helps us deal with others with relatively lesser anxiety, resentment and conflict.

It turns us calm when we are around others as we believe in capabilities to handle difficult situations.

It helps us remain in the moment rather than virtually wandering around which apparently affects our interaction with others.

It clearly offers us the path to be self-reliant.

 It acclaims that others have their rights too, to live their lives the way they want.

We all are riders of our own vehicles and it totally depends on us how we want to veer across the road. Thus, reducing helplessness reduces depression.

**In spite of all such benefits through acquiring assertiveness, we stay engrossed in aggressive behavior which is going to us in no way.**

LET'S GET STARTED WITH RESILIENS TO STRAT YOUR OWN JOURNEY OF ASSERTIVENESS

## **TYPES OF BEHAVIOR**

As we discussed earlier, we saw a number of advantages of an assertive behavior then why don't we strive to achieve this trait? Let's review the types of behaviors to identify which behavior we engage in the most:

**PASSIVE BEHAVIOR:** It is well known that we work hard to please others no matter what, not considering our own **wanting**. Such characteristic makes us weak and stop us from **thinking rightly.** We basically are afraid to take responsibility of our feelings and behavior which prevent us from facing challenges. **Even if someone tries to approach us for some sort of help, we refuse to take it.**

**DIRECT AGGRESSION:** We often confuse aggression for assertion while the main characteristic of an aggressive person is not listening to others plus doing what one wants to do. Here, we do not see any kind of negotiation or compromise **and is often made equal to losing.** Whenever a challenging situation occurs, we deal it with physical or verbal strengths. 

**INDIRECT AGGRESSION:** Indirect aggression is a subtle form of aggression and it is actually the fear of being overly aggressive. Its effects are as bad as direct aggression, though it is difficult to find out if someone is **suffering from such a behavior**. Those who suffer from this type of aggression faces low self-confidence and self-esteem just like those with direct aggression.   

Thus, we see four types of behavior including assertiveness. So, recognize the kind of behavior you are engaged in so that you can help yourself out along with RESILIENS. Our app guides you to achieve optimum assertiveness. So, get ready and  **FIGHT**! 

## **SET THE MYTHS ON FIRE**

Think yourself, what is an assertive behavior? You will surely get either a confusing answer or an absolute myths as an answer. Such myths stop us from being assertive. Let's burn some of them right here.

1. Assertiveness is the same as aggressiveness

Reality: Some people often consider aggression as a form of assertiveness and believe that there is not much difference between them. In fact, those with aggressive nature also believe that they are assertive by nature while the thing they do is only indulging in what they need. 

2, I will get what I want by being assertive

Reality: Being assertive does not necessarily mean that you will be able to accomplish all your wishes. What being assertive does is helping you respond in your best possible way. Assertiveness basically teaches us not only respecting our personal needs but also think about the needs of others.

3. To become assertive, I have to change my core self

Reality: Assertiveness does not refer to changing ourselves completely, rather it helps us be keep being aware of our rights and prioritize our needs. It also helps us know our limits and league and also making others know about them.

4. **There is not need to be assertive with close friends**

Reality: We often think like our friends and family are pretty close to us so we do  not need to be assertive with them while the truth is even our **close ones do not many of our needs, I**n order to make them know what we want, we must behave assertively even with them.

5. Others will love you only when you are passive:

Reality: Those with passive nature usually agree with what others say and do not prioritize their needs. In fact, others might see us as boring and may even get frustrated of not showing any interest in voicing what we want.

## **RESULTS OF NOT BEING ASSERTIVE**

A big consequence of not being assertive could be a low sense of self-worth. By exercising passiveness, we forget to prioritize our needs and wanting, and keep on agreeing with what others say. This for certain, makes us feel incomplete and powerless. Suppressing our feelings and thoughts can only make us feel stressed and anxious.

We even feel all lonely and unworthy to the point that we underrate ourselves which can result in issues with many kinds of relationships. In addition to such results, we see that aggressive people usually get cut off from their circle as people do not tend to like such people. They start losing friends and people don't respect them.

Those who lack assertiveness are more likely to develop social anxiety and start feeling that people judge them negatively and will be evaluated by others. Thus, they avoid social gatherings. **Those who are assertive are less depressive, this is what researches show.** 

Developing assertiveness within yourself might look difficult at first but gradually you develop the quality by putting little bit of effort.
