# What is Resilience? 

 Resilience has been defined by the American Psychological Association as ‘a process of good adaptation in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or other significant sources of stressors such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems or financial problems. It can be viewed as a measure of stress coping ability in response to adversity and is used as a target in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and stress problems.

Being resilient does not mean that you will not experience traumas or difficult life experiences; it means that you are able to cope and recover from them. Building skills to develop resiliency can help you handle adversity without falling apart.

Five Steps Towards Building Resiliency 

#### Practice Acceptance 

Acceptance is one of the first steps to building resiliency and can help with your process of healing. Acceptance means being honest with yourself about the situation you are in and being honest about the emotions you are feeling rather than trying to resist or reject them. When you practice acceptance, you are choosing to acknowledge that you cannot change the situation, instead, you can make space for it. 

#### Recover Personal Control 

Unfortunate life events can make you doubt whether you have control over your life. For example, unexpected death in your life could make you question mortality or if you have personal control over anything in your life. By acknowledging that you have agency in your life to make the choices that you want to see happen, you are recovering and regaining personal control. 

#### Readdress Personal Goals 

 When you achieve a goal, your brain builds a sense of mastery and you start to feel like you are capable of making goals and attaining them. Also, readdressing personal goals can help you assess whether there are new areas in your life where you might be craving growth (e.g. feeling like it is time to start dating again, assessing whether your job is a good fit).

#### Think Optimistically 

When you are going through a tough experience, it can be hard to find reasons to be optimistic. This is when we revisit step 1, practicing acceptance, before starting to practice optimism. By practicing acceptance of the situation, we can begin to find ways to think optimistically about the ways that we can grow from each experience and find meaning. Though there may not be anything positive about the experience itself, every experience leads to an opportunity for growth, even if it can be hard to see at the moment. 

#### Seek Support Networks

When we are faced with hardships and unfortunate life circumstances, it may be helpful to connect to a support network. Support networks can include friends, family, community resources, therapists, etc. Gaining support from trusted individuals not only helps you build resiliency, but also helps you feel supported in the moments when supporting yourself feels difficult.
