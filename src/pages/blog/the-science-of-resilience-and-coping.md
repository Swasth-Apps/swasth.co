# What is Resilience? 

 Resilience has been defined by the American Psychological Association as ‘a process of good adaptation in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or other significant sources of stressors such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems or financial problems. It can be viewed as a measure of stress coping ability in response to adversity and is used as a target in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and stress problems.

Being resilient does not mean that you will not experience traumas or difficult life experiences; it means that you are able to cope and recover from them. Building skills to develop resiliency can help you handle adversity without falling apart.

Five Steps Towards Building Resiliency 

#### Practice Acceptance 

Acceptance is one of the first steps to building resiliency and can help with your process of healing. Acceptance means being honest with yourself about the situation you are in and being honest about the emotions you are feeling rather than trying to resist or reject them. When you practice acceptance, you are choosing to acknowledge that you cannot change the situation, instead, you can make space for it. 

#### Recover Personal Control 

Unfortunate life events can make you doubt whether you have control over your life. For example, unexpected death in your life could make you question mortality or if you have personal control over anything in your life. By acknowledging that you have agency in your life to make the choices that you want to see happen, you are recovering and regaining personal control. 

#### Readdress Personal Goals 

 When you achieve a goal, your brain builds a sense of mastery and you start to feel like you are capable of making goals and attaining them. Also, readdressing personal goals can help you assess whether there are new areas in your life where you might be craving growth (e.g. feeling like it is time to start dating again, assessing whether your job is a good fit).

#### Think Optimistically 

When you are going through a tough experience, it can be hard to find reasons to be optimistic. This is when we revisit step 1, practicing acceptance, before starting to practice optimism. By practicing acceptance of the situation, we can begin to find ways to think optimistically about the ways that we can grow from each experience and find meaning. Though there may not be anything positive about the experience itself, every experience leads to an opportunity for growth, even if it can be hard to see at the moment. 

#### Seek Support Networks

When we are faced with hardships and unfortunate life circumstances, it may be helpful to connect to a support network. Support networks can include friends, family, community resources, therapists, etc. Gaining support from trusted individuals not only helps you build resiliency, but also helps you feel supported in the moments when supporting yourself feels difficult. 

# The Connection between Resilience and Emotion

Resilience can help protect you from various mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. Resilience can also help offset factors that increase the risk of mental health conditions, such as being bullied or previous trauma.

Resilient individuals have built skills to help cope with experiences that could negatively impact their mental health, such as being bullied. For example, if you are frequently in a state of crisis and it is affecting your relationships, work-life, and personal life, it could be difficult to identify positive emotions. It is in these moments when you should explore different activities that elicit positive emotions, such as sticking to your gym routine, making home-cooked meals, taking your dog to a park, etc. Building resiliency involves working through difficult times by utilizing your resources, individual strengths, support network, and practicing acceptance.  

# Five Benefits of Resiliency 

Every day we face different challenges in our lives and we need to have the strength to fight the same. It is natural to feel anger and anxiety if caught in a traumatizing situation.

Resiliency can be beneficial for the following reasons: 

* Improved self-perception. Building skills towards resilience betters our self-perception because we are able to acknowledge and accept that we can overcome and move through tough situations. We are able to prove to ourselves that we can survive hardships, thus making us more resilient.
* Improved working memory. Our working memory is our short term memory where we store thoughts that help with reasoning, thinking, decision-making, judging, and language comprehension. An example of working memory is storing an address in your mind while trying to listen to instructions about how to get there. Researchers have shown that working memory processes promote resilience-enabling behaviors, such as finding possible solutions to adverse or difficult circumstances.
* Health benefits (e.g., improved rest, lower rates of depression, greater satisfaction with life). Building skills towards resiliency can lead to health benefits, such as improved rest, lower rates of depression, and greater overall life satisfaction. 
* Improved ability to cope with stress and adapt. Resiliency helps us cope with stressful situations because we are better able to adapt.
