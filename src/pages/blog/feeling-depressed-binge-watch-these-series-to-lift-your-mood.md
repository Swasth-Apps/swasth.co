There are times when life seems so blue or depressing that nothing makes me happy. During these days, all I want is to lie on my couch with a bucket full of popcorn and binge watch some fantastic web series.

Often, distracting my mind towards something lighter or interesting that isn’t directly connected to my life lifts my mood.

From so much content available online, it is hard to select the ones that would chase away your blues. But no worries! Today, I will share my personal favorites, which will grip you with their storylines and make you feel good.

Read to dive deep in the world of entertainment?

## 1. F.R.I.E.N.D.S

It’s hard not to begin the list without the world-class comedy that has not been passed on to generations. Friends are light, funny, and addictive. It casts six friends who live across the hall and share whatever they face in life now and then. Whenever I feel myself at the bottom of my career, the gorgeous “Rachel” somehow gives me hope never to give up. From being a jobless and total spoilt brat, the girl ended up getting a job in the industry she was most passionate about. Whenever my obsessive thoughts take a toll on me and make me imagine the worst in every situation, the quirky Phoebe inspires me to look at the brighter side of life. Whenever I find myself not fitting in the norms, the Perfectionist Monica reminded me that I only have to be myself, and the right person would love me whole-heartedly.

So yeah, binge-watching “Friends” is something that would provide you with an escape from the ordinary.

## 2. Hannah Montana

Yes, you read it correctly, HANNAH MONTAAANAAA!!! At least, this is what I used to call it in my childhood days. There is something about this Disney series and the comfort it provides by taking us back to old times. Perhaps it’s because it reminds us of simpler days when our only worries were school homework and tests. And yes, the shows like Hannah Montana can be easily be interchanged with the following- the Amanda Show, Wizards of Waverly Place, That’s so raven, or whichever nostalgic goodness you’re in the mood of.

## 3. Money Heist

The premise of the series is that a group of thieves lock themselves in along with the employees they have taken hostage after attacking the Royal Mint of Spain. A story that covers two timelines- past & present is something you would love to get lost in. So, what are you waiting for? Check out some OTT and be prepared for the heist.

## 4. Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D

Even if you haven’t watched Marvel movies, S.H.I.E.L.D. is a stand-alone work and shall keep you hooked for a long time. The show introduces various characters equipped with superpowers. Some characters have superpowers, while others have scientific prowess, and all of these members come together to form the most formidable division called S.H.I.E.L.D. The action-packed fantasy series would help in a good escape from reality and help in distressing a bit.

## 5. Vanderpump Rules

Ah, a reality show- the hamper should always be in the end, no? Vanderpump Rules is full of drama, and like any reality show, it attempts to handle some pretty sensitive topics from time-to-time. Apart from that, watching characters who don’t have their shit together is undoubtedly going to make you feel better about whatever shitty situation you are finding yourself in.

The list is unending, and I have only mentioned my personal favorites. Don’t forget to share it with your folks. Till then, Happy Distressing!
