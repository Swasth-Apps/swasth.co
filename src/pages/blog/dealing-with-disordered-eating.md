## **UNDERSTANDING EATING DISORDERS**

![](static/img/disordered3.jfif)

 Evidence suggests that genes and heritability play a part in why some people are at higher risk for an eating disorder, but these disorders can also afflict those with no family history of the condition. Treatment should address psychological, behavioral, nutritional, and other medical complications. The latter can include consequences of malnutrition or of purging behaviors including, heart and gastrointestinal problems as well as other potentially fatal conditions. Ambivalence towards treatment, denial of a problem with eating and weight, or anxiety about changing eating patterns is not uncommon. With proper medical care, however, those with eating disorders can resume healthy eating habits, and recover their emotional and psychological health.

Eating disorders are behavioral conditions characterized by severe and persistent disturbance in eating behaviors and associated distressing thoughts and emotions. They can be very serious conditions affecting physical, psychological, and social function. Types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, other specified feeding and eating disorder, pica, and rumination disorder.

## **TYPES OF EATING DISORDERS**

**Anorexia Nervosa**

Dieting behavior in anorexia nervosa is driven by an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. Although some individuals with anorexia will say they want and are trying to gain weight, their behavior is not consistent with this intent. For example, they may only eat small amounts of low-calorie foods and exercise excessively. Some persons with anorexia nervosa also intermittently binge eat and or purge by vomiting or laxative misuse.

There are two subtypes of anorexia nervosa:

* **restricting type:** in which individuals lose weight primarily by dieting, fasting, or excessively exercising, and
* **binge-eating/purging type:** in which persons also engage in intermittent binge eating and/or purging behaviors.

  **Bulimia Nervosa**

  Binges occur at least weekly and are typically followed by what are called “compensatory behaviors” to prevent weight gain. These can include fasting, vomiting, laxative misuse, or compulsive exercise. As in anorexia nervosa, persons with bulimia nervosa are excessively preoccupied with thoughts of food, weight, or shape which negatively affect, and disproportionately impact, their self-worth.

  **Binge eating**

  People with binge eating disorder have episodes of binge eating in which they consume large quantities of food in a brief period, experience a sense of loss of control over their eating, and are distressed by the binge behavior. Unlike people with bulimia nervosa however, they do not regularly use compensatory behaviors to get rid of the food by inducing vomiting, fasting, exercising, or laxative misuse. Binge eating is chronic and can lead to serious health complications.

  **Other specified feeding/eating disorders**

  This diagnostic category includes eating disorders or disturbances of eating behavior that causes distress and impairs family, social, or work function but does not fit the other categories listed here. In some cases, this is because the frequency of the behavior does not meet the diagnostic threshold (e.g., the frequency of binges in bulimia or binge eating disorder) or the weight criteria for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa are not met.

  **Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder**

  Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a recently defined eating disorder that involves a disturbance in eating resulting in persistent failure to meet nutritional needs and extreme picky eating. 

  ## **IMPACTS OF EATING DISORDERS**

  **Physical changes**

  Without an adequate intake of food, and often in the face of excessive daily exercise, patients can suffer physical health repercussions from eating disorders rather quickly. The physical symptoms may initially manifest as stomach cramps, dizziness, fainting spells, dry skin, brittle nails, and muscle weakness. Weight loss may not actually be immediately noticeable, but will likely become obvious as the eating disorder progresses in severity.

  **Emotional and behavioral changes**

   Eating disorders can have an incredibly negative impact on mental health. Eating disorder symptoms and behaviors can reinforce disordered thought patterns, leading to the constant degradation of self-esteem. Already low self-esteem levels may plummet as the disordered thought patterns and compulsive behaviors serve to reinforce each other. Furthermore, the disordered thoughts urge, and behaviors caused by eating disorders can lead to depression and anxiety.

  **Impact on work-life**

  A mind full of foods and stuff makes it difficult to work and fatigue out of the inadequate intake of food adds to the problem, ultimately leading your way to worse work-life as you might get panelized for not showing enough concern towards your work.

  **Impact on social life**

  Binge eating and other symptoms may arise a feeling of shame inside the individuals and they start avoiding their dear ones causing them a miserable life without close friends and family members.

  ## **ARE YOU READY FOR CHANGE?**

  Studies have shown that changes include a number of stages as follows:

  * Precontemplation stage: A person who is not ready and willing to change can be characterized to be on this stage. For example, a woman who has lost weight but doesn’t recognize it to be problematic.
  * Contemplation stage: Here, the person acknowledges the problem but doesn’t take any action to change it. For example, a woman realizes that she has a problem and lost weight but doesn’t seek help as he fears gaining weight.
  * Preparation stage: In this stage, the person prepares in order to make changes. For example, a woman takes a number of local clinics but hasn’t called up yet.
  * Action stage: Here the person is actively involved in change. For example, women are completely involved and engaged in treatment.

    Analyze different stages and try to figure out which stage you are at. It may take a good time to realize that you are a disordered eater but as it is said, THE SOONER THE BETTER, why wait for the right time when it's already up. Brace yourself and join us for further help.
