## Introducing Post-traumatic Stress

Post-traumatic stress can result from several kinds of experiences which attack a person's morale and psyche. According to epidemiological studies conducted in the United States, prevalence rates for exposure to traumatic stressors may be as high as [70% of the adult population](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290679321_ACT_with_Posttraumatic_Stress_Disorder). Trauma-related experiences come in many forms: it can be criminal victimization (rape, assault, armed robbery), domestic assault, childhood sexual abuse, natural catastrophes (tornado, fire), and so on. Ordinary human responses to post-traumatic stress with avoidance, numbing, or derealization. These reactions have a particular adaptive value. With time, they obliviate themselves as the person combats the impact of trauma in functional ways like physical activities, healthy conversations, and tender support. However, for some trauma survivors, this adaptive integration does not take place. Instead, the trauma's impact grows further that it causes severe impairment in psychological and behavioral operations. Studies suggest that about 8% of the general population display Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. Many trauma survivors seek therapy to address their painful struggles with the aftermath of trauma and live a more meaningful life free of stress and anxiety.

## What is ACT?

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a recently introduced form of psychotherapy used to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, focusing on mindfulness and acceptance.

According to ACT's underlying theory, mental health concerns result from attempting to avoid a distressing experience; thus, the goal of treatment with ACT is to build a more accepting, mindful attitude towards painful memories and distressing situations rather than suppressing them through dysfunctional behaviors. There are other psychotherapies as well, such as DBT and CBT, which focuses on symptom reduction and change.

ACT primarily involves activities, role-playing, and metaphors as part of treatment.

## Why ACT?

Our mind is molded in a way that we can systematically label our emotions to be positive or negative. For example, sadness is viewed as a negative emotion, whereas joy or excitement is determined as positive emotions. We often aim to equalize the number of positive emotions with negative ones, to acquire better mental health. However, in an attempt to increase happiness in life, we often run away from painful feelings and apply avoidance. Although this may give us temporary relief, it causes psychological disorders and severe stress in the long-run. For example, a person who's lived a traumatic childhood will be haunted by memories and anxiety or stress. As a result, the person may find short-term relief through drug dependency or alcohol. Although it might do some good in forgetting the pain for some time, it will do nothing to alleviate the emotional turmoil. Instead, the existing pain will worsen and introduce a new set of problems. Therefore, acceptance should be a way of life, and working up your approach to commitment and self-confidence can help you live a meaningful life. The purpose of ACT is to enable people to be both open and transparent in experiencing their inner feelings. At the same time, they are attentive to their physical and emotional sensations, without displaying harmful habits of avoidance or escape.

## The Five Goals of ACT

ACT for PTSD focuses on five integral goals that, if pursued, can help you immensely in the long-run. These goals can empower you with self-confidence, self-awareness, and commitment towards betterment.

### 1. Accept that Avoidance will not help

ACTtherapists call this "goal creative hopelessness." You can achieve this goal if you accept that avoiding painful emotions is not a wise job, and it's never an effective solution to eliminating unpleasant elements from your life.

### 2. Understanding that Controlling is not the solution

This is a significant goal in the process of ACT as it helps you to understand that controlling your emotional pain might have an opposite effect on yourself: it can worsen your stress and forbid the ways that may lead you to positive aspects of life.

### 3. Separate yourself from thoughts

Frequently, we indulge in "black and white thinking" and conveniently eliminate the other shades of opinions that exist in between. A person with PTSD may have thoughts like "I'm broken," "I'm damaged," "I can never be happy," and so on. When such thoughts invade your mind, it's essential to realize that they are only your assumptions with no factual evidence or information.

### 4. Stopping the Struggle

This fourth goal is often compared to "tug-of-war," and it says to let go of your hurtful feelings, and put an end to controlling overwhelming emotions. Instead, experience your thoughts and feelings like they are and not for what you think they are.

### 5. Committing to Action

Avoiding emotional pain can consume a considerable amount of energy in people with PTSD. It can take over your life. Therefore, the most crucial goal of ACT for PTSD is to identify areas of importance and values in your life and spend your time indulging in things that are consistent with those values, no matter what.

## Conclusion

Several people have reported development in using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If you are struggling with symptoms of PTSD, ACT for PTSD may be enormously helpful. Although, it is advised that you seek help from professional therapists or psychologists to deal with such delicate mental health concerns.
