## What is Addiction?

There are many definitions, but one of the most fundamental characteristics of addiction is the mandatory repetition of harmful behaviors. These self-harming actions are dangerous and examples include alcohol and drug abuse, overeating, and unsafe sexual practices.

## DBT for Addiction

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is one of the most promising treatments for addiction. Invented by [Dr. Marsha Linehan](https://behavioraltech.org/about-us/founded-by-marsha/), DBT helps in treating compulsive patterns of self-harming via easy and effective techniques. As recently revealed, these techniques come from her insights, though at a huge personal cost (struggles with mental illness). Though Dr. Marsha was never a substance abuser herself, like many abusers, she was trapped in self-loathing, self-harm, psychic pain, and a downward spiral of shame from which there doesn't seem any escape.

DBT helps addicts via different skills-[Distress Tolerance](https://www.swasth.co/blog/distress-tolerance-skills-in-dbt/), [Mindfulness](https://www.swasth.co/blog/mindfulness-in-dbt/), [Emotional Regulation](https://www.swasth.co/blog/emotion-regulation/), and [Interpersonal Effectiveness](https://www.swasth.co/blog/interpersonal-effectiveness-in-dbt-learn-effective-communication-skills/). These skills help in correcting problematic behaviors that lead to addiction.

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) helps in restoring a person's emotional balance and eliminating their dependency on their addiction. A typical treatment moves through multiple stages, including the following-

1. It helps the addicts in seeking out peers and environments that discourage substance abuse.
2. Restores behavioral control that helps in eliminating life-threatening behaviors.
3. Aids the individuals in opening-up and express their emotions freely.
4. Encourage the removal of triggers like drug paraphernalia, or any unhealthy relationships.
5. It helps in coping with relapses and cravings.
6. Aids in removing environmental and social triggers for substance abuse such as events, places, and people.
7. Restores the sense of connection and completeness in an individual's life.

The last step is essential as people with addictions often don’t feel connected to the world around them. Forming connections and finding purpose help achieve sobriety.
