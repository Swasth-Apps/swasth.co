## **UNDERSTANDING SELF-HARM**

 Self-harm, often simply called self-injury, is the act of deliberately harming your own body, such as cutting or burning yourself. It's typically not meant as a suicide attempt. Rather, this type of self-injury is a harmful way to cope with emotional pain, intense anger and frustration.

While self-injury may bring a momentary sense of calm and a release of tension, it's usually followed by guilt and shame and the return of painful emotions. Although life-threatening injuries are usually not intended, with self-injury comes the possibility of more-serious and even fatal self-aggressive actions. Getting appropriate treatment can help you learn healthier ways to cope. Self-harm usually comes into effect sneakily and at the place where people barely go and is done the way so that it naturally leaves a mark on the body. Some of such examples include:

* Cutting (cuts or severe scratches with a sharp object)
* Scratching
* Burning (with lit matches, cigarettes or heated, sharp objects such as knives)
* Carving words or symbols on the skin
* Self-hitting, punching or head banging
* Piercing the skin with sharp objects
* Inserting objects under the skin

Mostly, hands, legs and torso are primarily targeted to harm oneself, but any other area of the body could also be used. People with the mindset of self-harm can injure themselves at different parts of the body.

## **SYMPTOMS OF SELF-HARM**

Some of the symptoms of self-harm could be as follows:

* Scars, often in specific patterns
* Fresh cuts, burns, bruises, bite marks or other wounds
* Excessive rubbing of an area to create a burn
* Keeping sharp objects on hand
* Wearing long sleeves or long pants, even in hot weather, as a mode of hiding bruises
* Frequent events of accidental injury
* Difficulties in interpersonal relationships
* Behavioral and emotional instability, impulsivity and intense reactions
* Statements of helplessness, hopelessness or worthlessness

  So, if you are hurting yourself even in a minor way, reach out to a therapist as you are into the cognitive dysfunction of self-harm. Any sort of self-injury is a sign of self-harming behavior. 

  ## **RISK FACTORS**

  The people who are indulged in self-harm the most, are the adolescents and young adults since emotions are overly active during such periods and people face loads of psychological issues. There are certain factors that may elevate the risks of self-injury, such as:

  **Having friends who self-injure.** People who have friends who harm themselves are knowingly, are more likely to begin self-harming.

  **Life issues.** Some people who injure themselves were ignored intentionally, were sexually, physically or emotionally harassed, or experienced some traumatic events. They may have grown up and still remain in an unhealthy family environment, or they may be young people questioning their personal identity. Some people who self-injure are socially isolated.

  **Mental health issues.** People who self-harm are more likely to be highly self-critical. Additionally, self-injury is commonly associated with certain mental disorders, such as borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders.

  **Alcohol or drug use.** People who harm self-injure often do so while under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs.

  ## BREAKING DOWN THE SETTLED MYTHS

  There are a lot of things that are associated with self-harming behavior and are related to the people who injure themselves. Self-harm is barely understood by people and they make perceptions themselves in regards to those who are suffering from such a critical mental sickness. Let us now look at some of those myths.

  ##### Myth : Self-harm is an attention-seeking behavior.

  While some people may believe that self-harming is a method of seeking attention, this is often not the case. There is shame surrounding self-harm, and those who engage in this behavior will often cover their injuries with bandages or by wearing long sleeves so that others do not notice. In this way, self-harm is not attention-seeking.

  ##### Myth : Self-harm is a suicide attempt.

  Individuals who self-harm often do not intend to end their lives. Instead, they are using self-harm to cope with emotions or trauma. Self-harming behaviors can actually release endorphins, which can improve mood and relieve pain. Other people may find that self-harming is a way for them to experience some sort of emotion if they have been feeling devoid of emotions.

  ##### Myth 8: People self-injure as a way to pretend

  It is a common misconception that people self-injure as a form of pretension. However, pretension is typically not the primary intent of self-harming behavior. Self-harm is for stress relief, according to experts.

  **MYTH: ‘Only girls self-harm’**

  It is often assumed that women are more likely to self-harm than men, however it isn’t clear if this is true. People usually self-harm to find an escape route from their ongoing troubles, and anybody can face distressing emotions, irrespective of sex.

  **MYTH: ‘People who self-harm must enjoy it’**

  Some think that people who self-harm take pleasure in the pain or risk associated in such a dangerous action. However, the truth is anyone who harms themselves can endure terrible pain. For some, depression has made them numb and they want to feel anything to remind themselves of their own presence. Some have described this pain as punishment. 

  ## **USING DBT FOR TREATMENT**
