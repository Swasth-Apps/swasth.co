description: Self-harm, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, are transdiagnostic
  difficulties. Self-harm is often viewed as a behavioral strategy which is
  implemented as a consequence of difficulty in regulating effect. Therapeutic
  approaches for working with self-harm include risk-management planning,
  developing and practicing effective emotional regulation strategies, and
  reducing reactivity to triggers for self-harm. DBT states, self-harm is the
  behavioral consequence of distressing thoughts and emotions. Individuals who
  self-harm may be experiencing high levels of affect and often have few or
  ineffective coping strategies.

## **UNDERSTANDING SELF-HARM**

 Self-harm, often simply called self-injury, is the act of deliberately harming your own body, such as cutting or burning yourself. It's typically not meant as a suicide attempt. Rather, this type of self-injury is a harmful way to cope with emotional pain, intense anger and frustration.

While self-injury may bring a momentary sense of calm and a release of tension, it's usually followed by guilt and shame and the return of painful emotions. Although life-threatening injuries are usually not intended, with self-injury comes the possibility of more-serious and even fatal self-aggressive actions. Getting appropriate treatment can help you learn healthier ways to cope. Self-harm usually comes into effect sneakily and at the place where people barely go and is done the way so that it naturally leaves a mark on the body. Some of such examples include:

* Cutting (cuts or severe scratches with a sharp object)
* Scratching
* Burning (with lit matches, cigarettes or heated, sharp objects such as knives)
* Carving words or symbols on the skin
* Self-hitting, punching or head banging
* Piercing the skin with sharp objects
* Inserting objects under the skin

Mostly, hands, legs and torso are primarily targeted to harm oneself, but any other area of the body could also be used. People with the mindset of self-harm can injure themselves at different parts of the body.
