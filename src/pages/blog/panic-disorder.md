## **WHAT IS PANIC DISORDER?**

![](static/img/anxiety5.jpg "panic")

The Panic disorder includes recurrent panic attacks about an anticipated increase in the number of future attacks. The person changes his/her behavior in an unacceptable way out of panic attacks. The panic attacks are associated with abrupt surges of intense fear or uneasiness that reaches the topmost point within a few seconds, along with some cognitive fluctuations. Panic attacks may arise due to a feared situation or unexpected reasons.

Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder. It causes panic attacks, which are sudden feelings of terror when there is no real danger. You may feel as if you are losing control. Panic attacks can happen anytime, anywhere, and without warning. You may live in fear of another attack and may avoid places where you have had an attack. For some people, fear takes over their lives and they cannot leave their homes.

Considering the studies so far concerning gender, it has been found  that women are more prone to panic disorder, almost twice or thrice more likely to be affected than men. The cause of such a difference could be mental instability because of separation or divorce.

## **CHARACTERISTICS FEATURES OF PANIC DISORDER**

**Panic Attack Symptoms** 

• Skipping, racing, or pounding heart

• Sweating 

• Trembling or shaking 

• Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 

• Choking sensations 

• Chest pain, pressure, or discomfort 

• Nausea, stomach problems, or sudden diarrhea 

• Dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint 

• Tingling or numbness in parts of your body 

• Chills or heat sensations 

• Feeling things around you are strange, unreal, detached, unfamiliar, or feeling detached from the body 

• Thoughts of losing control or going crazy 

• Fear of dying 

**Characteristics of a Panic Attack** 

• It peaks quickly - between 1 to 10 minutes 

• The apex of the panic attack lasts for approximately 5 to 10 minutes (unless constantly rekindled) 

• The initial attack is usually described as “coming out of the blue” and not consistently associated with a specific situation, although with time panics can become associated with specific situations 

• The attack is not linked to marked physical exertion 

• The attacks are recurrent over time 

• During an attack the person experiences a strong urge to escape to safety 

While a report states that individuals may also feel like they may faint anytime while having an attack. However, this statement cannot be true as the biological system related to fainting is exactly the opposite of the one that produces panic attacks.

## **CAUSES OF PANIC ATTACKS**

**TEMPERAMENTAL CAUSES**

Factors identified for the onset of panic attacks are negative affectivity which is a proneness to experiencing negative emotions, and anxiety sensitivity, that is, the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful. Although their risk status for the diagnosis of panic disorder is unknown. Due to this, the person has an increased focus on bodily sensations such as tightness in the chest, breathlessness, dizziness, sweating because they are worried about having a panic attack.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES**

* Chronic physical illnesses such as cancer
* Experiencing a significant personal loss, including a break-up with a romantic partner
* Significant life changes such as losing a job, becoming a parent, moving house, etc.
* ‘Maintaining’ behaviors such as avoiding panic-provoking situations or environments, anxious/negative self-talk, dysfunctional beliefs, and feelings.

**PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSES**

* Chronic ***stress***
* An existing mental health condition such as **\*anxiety**, **depression**, **obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)**, or **post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)***
* ***Phobias*** - people may experience panic attacks as a direct result of exposure to a phobic object or situation
* Lack of assertiveness - a growing body of evidence supports the idea that those who suffer from panic attacks engage in a passive style of communication or interactions with others
* Low self-esteem
