## **WHAT IS PANIC DISORDER?**

Panic disorder includes recurrent panic attacks about an  anticipated increase in number of future attacks. The person changes his/her behavior in an unacceptable way out of panic attacks. The panic attacks are associated with abrupt surges of intense fear or uneasiness that reaches the topmost point within a few seconds, along with some cognitive fluctuations. Panic attacks may arise due to a feared situation or unexpected reasons.

Panic disorder is a type of [anxiety disorder](https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html). It causes panic attacks, which are sudden feelings of terror when there is no real danger. You may feel as if you are losing control. Panic attacks can happen anytime, anywhere, and without warning. You may live in fear of another attack and may avoid places where you have had an attack. For some people, fear takes over their lives and they cannot leave their homes.

Considering the studies so far with respect to gender, it has been found out that women are more prone to panic disorder, almost twice or thrice more likely to be affected than men. The cause of such a difference could be mental instability because of separation or divorce.

## **CHARACTERISTICS FEATURES OF PANIC DISORDER**

**Panic Attack Symptoms** 

• Skipping, racing or pounding heart

• Sweating 

• Trembling or shaking 

• Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 

• Choking sensations 

• Chest pain, pressure or discomfort 

• Nausea, stomach problems or sudden diarrhea 

• Dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint 

• Tingling or numbness in parts of your body 

• Chills or heat sensations 

• Feeling things around you are strange, unreal, detached, unfamiliar, or feeling detached from body 

• Thoughts of losing control or going crazy 

• Fear of dying 

**Characteristics of a Panic Attack** 

• It peaks quickly - between 1 to 10 minutes 

• The apex of the panic attack lasts for approximately 5 to 10 minutes (unless constantly rekindled) 

• The initial attack is usually described as “coming out of the blue” and not consistently associated with a specific situation, although with time panics can become associated with specific situations 

• The attack is not linked to marked physical exertion 

• The attacks are recurrent over time 

• During an attack the person experiences a strong urge to escape to safety 

While a report states that individuals may also feel like they may faint anytime while having an attack. However, this statement cannot be true as the biological system related to fainting is exactly opposite to that of the one which produces panic attacks.
