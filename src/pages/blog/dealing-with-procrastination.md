## **WHAT IS PROCRASTINATION**

If we trace back to the origin of the word " Procrastination", we find that it is taken from two LATIN words, pro and crastinate, which mean forward and tomorrow respectively. We often come across people say, " there is always a tomorrow to have wonders" and then they feel a tint of relief by thinking that they can complete the task tomorrow. The hidden meaning is based on the behavior of practicing a negative cycle. Once you attain procrastination, you start believing that delays won't cause any sort of harm or even if it does, it's not like it will affect your future in some way. You in fact begin postponing your plans or indulge in substituting an alternative activity.

Procrastination varies depending on the level of severity of the behavior. It is generally a continuum that keeps us  engaged in delaying tasks and in extreme cases, you generalize significant fields of your life and lose the importance of a quality life. We basically start lacking in self-awareness and that self-awareness is a key part which is why procrastinating makes us feel so rotten. When we procrastinate, we are not only aware of avoiding the task in question, but also that doing so is probably a bad idea. And yet, we do it anyway.

## **THE TWO-STAGE PROCESS OF PROCRASTINATION**

Procrastination is a process that includes acts and patterns. Procrastination acts are general and random, and are inconsistent. Procrastination delays are intentional and there is no involvement of forgetfulness. It involves a sequence which initially involves feeling of discomfort about a task and then aimlessly travelling to another irrelevant task. In most cases, procrastination can be simple avoidance of an activity but usually it is a two-stage process.

The first stage involves an urge to avoid a task for sometime or postpone it which does not come by itself but get stirred out of negative mood, discomfort, imagined condition or threat. The second stage also almost follows the first as you start reassuring yourself that the next is better since you simply tell yourself that nothing is at all wrong in delaying the task and you just need a warm-up.

Procrastination is characterized as involving active and passive phases. In the active phase, individuals are into daydreaming and napping instead of completing the task. While passive phase includes making excuses and giving false justifications.

## **PATTERNS OF PROSCRASTINATION**

It becomes important to know all the patterns of procrastination so as to overcome it. A few of the patterns are mentioned below:

**SOCIAL PROCRASTINATION**

Procrastination can have some serious affects on your social life especially your work. You try to find excuses for your delay in the task and come up with some or the other justifications. This may cause a tug-of-war within yourself as you find it difficult to catch up with all the activities around you or remain under stress since you postponed your work and another task is already up. You may get fired or penalized after a few warnings.

**PERSONAL PROCRASTINATION**

This pattern of procrastination arises when you delay your personal development or self-improvement continuously. You may also start avoiding your dear ones or might taking risks related to achieving goals which ultimately turns you into someone who runs away from quitting some seriously bad habits.

**THE SOCIAL-PERSONAL CONNECTION**

Personal and social procrastinations are much interlinked as your social behavior somehow affects your personal life and vice versa. The person who avoids or delays his/her work at office or his/her respective workplace seem to lose a significant amount of money as a pay cut which badly affects our financial status. Similarly, personal avoidance at some level impacts your professional life. For example, not completing the homework within the given time might cause your teacher to look down upon you.

The consequences of such behaviors push you into deep thinking where you only find yourself regretting on your life decisions and feeling sorry for what you have done so far. Thus, such patterns not only affect you but also your personal as well as professional lives.

## **CAUSES OF PROCRASTINATION**

Procrastination has been found to be linked with plenty of causes which could be considered as driving forces of procrastination. Some of these causes are:

**Low Frustration Tolerance and Discomfort Dodging**

Frustration is a part of our lives which cannot be fully avoided as it comes and goes by itself but managing frustration can be a challenging task to some people. Low frustration tolerance is a common trigger for discomfort dodging:

 1. you feel uncomfortable as you predict dealing with an unwanted situation;

 2. you realize the signs of discomfort, over-focus on them, and distract yourself from the task;

 3. You concentrate only on the tension, and this intensifies your feelings of stress.

*Dealing with Low-Frustration-Tolerance Self-Talk -* The best way to deal with procrastination is self-talking as you get to know very well what exactly you did and how you can improve yourself.



**Self-Doubt Procrastination** 

Some people tend to doubt themselves and underestimate their strengths, and thus hesitate. This behavior results in a number of failures as people get afraid of taking risks and challenges until there is some sort of assurance that you can succeed.

Altering a Self-Doubt View: Two basic challenges arise when procrastination results in self-doubting.

 1. to generate a belief system based on facts about yourself;

 2. To be assertive and firm to commit to a task and avoid the delay thus developing self-regulating skills and a sense of self-efficacy.
