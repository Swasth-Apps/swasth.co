## **UNDERSTANDING PERFECTIONISM**

![](static/img/mood-check.png)

Perfectionism is a tool required to give a boost to your functions in some way or the other. But overly engrossing yourself into something leads you to the darkest shore of life from where all the roots of mental illnesses start. To overcome your extreme desire to become a perfectionist, we need to know what it actually is. perfectionism includes three aspects as follows:

1. Nonstop striving for achieving high standards.
2. Judging yourself if you are worthy enough to achieve for what you seek. And,
3. Negative results of such expectations, and continuing to reach those already set standards.

Here we will explore the roots, causes, and problems of the disorder. In addition to that, we get to know how RESILIENS and RESILIFY can help you deal with perfectionism.

" Perfectionism is a self-destructive behavior that fuels your unnecessary thoughts".

DON'T WAIT! LET'S GET GOING!

## **TYPES OF PERFECTIONISM**

One may experience different kinds of facets of perfectionism but if you see yourself as a perfectionist then you may find yourself trying hard especially for three standards. These are:

PERFECT CONTEXT: This is the sort of perfectionism you acquire when you strive for a perfect situation to perform your actions, and it is most likely to lessen the number of situations in which you will perform.

PERFECT QUALITY: People with a type of perfectionism strive for the perfect quality desire for an imaginary standard, and think about them continuously that can be seen when it comes to cleanliness at the workplace and home.

PERFECT QUANTITY: It refers to being all unsatisfied with a performance when it doesn't match the expected level. This is the most common kind of perfectionism found in people, and look low at themselves if they fail to achieve the decided standard.

" Person striving for flawlessness in himself and setting heavily high-performance standards, accompanied by overly optimal evaluations is a perfectionist". 

## **HOW BAD IS IT TO BE A PERFECTIONIST?**

This cannot be denied that people take pride in calling themselves perfectionists, and the same feeling makes you feel super-efficient and valuable at the same time. Striving for something high may seem to help us loads to reach our goals but the actuality is, they act as a blockage on our track of happiness. Therefore, perfectionism is a destructive and irrational trait that can be a slow poison in disguise. It can have people suffer from anxiety and stress but still not being aware of the consequences. Some of its common consequences can be:

 **Being lowly happy as well as depressed**: When you do not catch up with what you have already expected once, you may start feeling stressed and unhappy.

**Self-Harming**: Some people even face severe urges to harm themselves if they do not achieve their decided goal such as cutting their veins or indulging in self-poisoning.

**Unhelpful Behavior**: These behaviors may include characteristics such as,

Avoidance:  This occurs from the fear of failure and eventually leading us to ignore various situations.

Procrastination: This basically happens because you being extremely optimal at doing things perfectly instead of just doing it well within time.

Performance checking: People with perfectionism often face challenges of checking deeply as they are much afraid of doing something inappropriately.

Counterproductive behavior:  We sometimes engage ourselves in some situations which we feel will help us but they actually do the opposite and turn us upside down.
