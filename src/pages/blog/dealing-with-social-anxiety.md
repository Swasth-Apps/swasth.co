## **A glance at understanding SOCIAL ANXIETY**

![](static/img/anxiety3.jfif)

Social anxiety is a term that is often used to describe fear, nervousness, and trouble in social situations. The behavior can be found in both, the shy ones as well as not-so-shy ones. Social anxiety has you believe in others judging you negatively all the time. Although judgment is something that helps us improve our qualities and make us self-aware, socially anxious people believe that they might fall into an aura of awkwardness once they start interacting with others as if the only thing people are going to do is judge or criticize them without any cause. The fear of getting humiliated prohibits us from being open to others. The Most common feared situations could be going out for dating, shopping, parties, or any other sort of social gatherings or even a proper one-to-one talk. Such behavior eventually lands us in isolation and get us to lose confidence. 

BUT ARE YOU WORRYING? NO NEED! GET ABOARD WITH US!

## Does Anxiety come by itself?

Knowing the cause and where the thing actually came from makes it way better in understanding and dealing with the problem and parallelly finding the solutions on the other side. A combination of elements plays a vital role in getting you stuck with an anxious mind. Let us find out what they are:

**Evolutionary Factors:** Anxiety benefitted many of our ancestors as it kept them aware of upcoming troubles. So, they spend enough time being cautious and thinking of tackling the threats. This could one reason why someone adapts to anxiety.

**Biological Factors:** Genes can another factor triggering your anxiety hormones as if you look at your family tree, you may find a few of your forefathers having the same kind of behavior as you have.

**Past childhood experiences:** Growing up in a particular surrounding plays a significant role in our traits, behavior, and lifestyle. Similarly, your anxiety can be an aftereffect of your past experiences, most likely your childhood memories.

**Significant life events:** All of us face some of the other kinds of life events where we could have gone through positive or negative changes in our lives as in break up, disputes with family members or even friends, and a lot more. All this mold our life in some way and may trigger anxiety.

## **Factors that keep social anxiety going**

Having understood what anxiety is, it becomes important to know what factors keep the behavior awake. Let's know:

**Perception of social threat:** We are most likely to develop anxiety when we perceive social threats. These threats result in heavy disaster if not cured. Therefore, whenever you seem to accumulate threats, you may develop the fear, nervousness as a response along with physical abnormalities such as heart palpitation, trembling, nausea and sweating.

**Negative thoughts:** A thoughts occupy our mind upon perceiving threats and these thoughts, most of the time, stay biased. The thoughts might include disturbing images, uncommon beliefs, and entangled words. People usually indulge in self-criticism and unknowingly look so low at themselves.

**Core beliefs:** We are no stranger to our childhood teachings of what is good and what all are bad. These significant life experiences shape our beliefs and our way of thinking about ourselves, others, and society. Core beliefs aren't general thoughts but beliefs that carve our mind, thus influencing social anxiety behavior.

**Avoidance:** To avoid situations where they fear they might face humiliation or criticism, people try not to head over to such places. The social fear persists as the underlying perception which is either not tested or challenged. Sadly, the behavior of avoidance only results in even more increment in anxiety.

**Safety behavior:** These are subtle avoidance behavior which makes us feel a bit comfortable in social situations. You may feel that adapting to such behavior can help in the long run but the truth is, they are maladaptive. They stop us from learning that fear is not permanent and we can overcome them.

All these factors discussed above work together to maintain fear and retain anxiety. They make us feel uncomfortable in social situations.
