description: Social anxiety is a mental health condition in which social
  interactions cause irrational anxiety. For people with such a disorder,
  everyday social interactions cause irrational anxiety, fear,
  self-consciousness and embarrassment. The disorder prevents you from living a
  healthy life plus you start avoiding the situations. Here in this blog, we
  will find the causes, types, help, treatment and ways to deal with the
  condition. We will also see, how our program can be at great help.
