description: Experiencing gratitude tends to impart positive feelings, which in
  turn, contribute to one's overall sense of well being. This suggests that
  gratitude produces better mental health by shifting one's attention away from
  toxic emotions. Research shows that being grateful increases our happiness and
  gives us a greater sense of wellbeing.
