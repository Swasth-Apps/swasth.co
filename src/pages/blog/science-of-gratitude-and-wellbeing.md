## **UNDERSTANDING GRATITUDE**

Gratitude is a thought when you are undergoing any sort of anxiety or stress. A gratitude formula can help you recognize and admire positive elements of your everyday life. If we dive deep into the meaning of gratitude, we find that it is derived from Latin word, gratia, which means graciousness or gratefulness. Gratitude is an acknowledgement for something tangible as well as intangible.

 People who regularly practice gratitude by spending time to notice and reflect upon the things they're thankful for experience more positive emotions, feel more alive, sleep better, express more compassion and kindness, and even have stronger immune systems. And gratitude doesn't need to be reserved only for momentous occasions: Sure, you might express gratitude after receiving a promotion at work, but you can also be thankful for something as simple as a delicious piece of pie.

## **HOW TO PRACTICE GRATITUDE**

**GRATITUDE JOURNALING**

Writing about the things you are even a bit thankful for on a daily basis is more than enough to help you develop a positive outlook of life. For this, a gratitude journal can be at help when you mention about the people or things you are grateful for so far.

**SAVORING WALKS**

Take the time to appreciate your surrounding environment like innocent animals, the vivid blue sky or evergreen trees. This is a 20-minute weekly walk that you can initiate all by yourself, enjoying your own company and experiencing an inner peace, via a different route each time. The idea is to pay attention during the walk to as many positive sights, sounds, and smells.

**A LETTER OF THANKS**

Write a letter to the person who has had a positive or changing effect in your life, be it at any point so far. You can even write this letter to he person whom you have been not in much contact with.

**MAKE IT A ROUTINE**

It is recommended to weave a gratitude practice into your everyday life, such as when you’re driving home from work, spending time with your family, or before going to sleep. 

## **ELIMINATING ANXIETY AND GRIEF WITH GRATITUDE**

Gratitude is the best cognitive tool which you can use to carve the happiness of your life. By simply giving or receiving acknowledgement can bring way too much pleasure that is difficult to explain in words. Gratitude is typically a state of thankfulness or state of being thankful.

**ELIMINATING ANXIETY**

By consciously practicing gratitude, we can train the brain to attend selectively to positive emotions and thoughts, thus reducing anxiety and feelings of apprehension.

**ELIMINATING STRESS**

 By being more grateful on the inside and expressing it on the outside, we gain the power to combat and cope with the stress.

**ELIMINATING DEPRESSION**

 By displacing our attention from problems to solutions, gratitude practices hit the serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin – neurotransmitters that make us feel good. With the surge of these chemicals in the brain, the apathy gets healed, and we revive the motivation that depression had sucked away.
