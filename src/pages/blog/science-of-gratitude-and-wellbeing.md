## **UNDERSTANDING GRATITUDE**

Gratitude is a **thought when you are undergoing any sort of anxiety or stress.** A gratitude formula can help you recognize and admire positive elements of your everyday life. If we dive deep into the meaning of gratitude, we find that it is derived from Latin word, gratia, which means graciousness or gratefulness. Gratitude is an acknowledgement for something tangible as well as intangible.

 People who regularly practice gratitude by spending time to notice and reflect upon the things they're thankful for experience more positive emotions, feel more alive, sleep better, express more compassion and kindness, and even have stronger immune systems. And gratitude doesn't need to be reserved only for momentous occasions: Sure, you might express gratitude after receiving a promotion at work, but you can also be thankful for something as simple as a delicious piece of pie.

## **HOW TO PRACTICE GRATITUDE**

**GRATITUDE JOURNALING**

Writing about the things you are even a bit thankful for on a daily basis is more than enough to help you develop a positive outlook of life. For this, a gratitude journal can be helpful in which you mention about the people or things you are grateful for so far.

**SAVORING WALKS**

Take the time to appreciate your surrounding environment like innocent animals, the vivid blue sky or evergreen trees. This is a 20-minute walk that you can initiate all by yourself, enjoying your own company and experiencing an inner peace, via a different route each time. The idea is to pay attention during the walk to as many positive sights, sounds, and smells.

**A LETTER OF THANKS**

Write a letter to the person who has had a positive or changing effect in your life, be it at any point so far. You can even write this letter to the person whom you have been not in much contact with.

**MAKE IT A ROUTINE**

It is recommended to weave a gratitude practice into your everyday life, such as when you’re driving home from work, spending time with your family, or before going to sleep. 

## **ELIMINATING ANXIETY AND GRIEF WITH GRATITUDE**

Gratitude is the best cognitive tool which you can use to carve the happiness of your life. By simply giving or receiving acknowledgement can bring way too much pleasure that is difficult to explain in words. Gratitude is typically a state of thankfulness or state of being thankful.

**ELIMINATING ANXIETY**

By consciously practicing gratitude, we can train the brain to attend selectively to positive emotions and thoughts, thus reducing anxiety and feelings of apprehension.

**ELIMINATING STRESS**

 By being more grateful on the inside and expressing it on the outside, we gain the power to combat and cope with the stress.

**ELIMINATING DEPRESSION**

 By displacing our attention from problems to solutions, gratitude practices hit the serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin – neurotransmitters that make us feel good. With the surge of these chemicals in the brain, the apathy gets healed, and we revive the motivation that depression had sucked away.

## **BENEFITS OF GRATITUDE**

Some of the significant benefits of gratitude are:

* Gratitude relieves us from toxic emotions.
* Gratitude helps even if the other person does not acknowledge it.
* Gratitude has positive effects on the brain and body.

For the individual:

* increased happiness and positive mood
* more satisfaction with life
* less materialistic
* less likely to experience burnout
* better physical health
* better sleep
* less fatigue
* lower levels of cellular inflammation
* greater resiliency
* encourages the development of patience, humility, and wisdom.

For groups:

* increases prosocial behaviors
* strengthens relationships
* may help employees’ effectiveness
* may increase job satisfaction.

Gratitude helps us find ways to express how grateful we are to have the support and to have the people themselves with us.

## **HOW TO MEASURE WELL -BEING**

What is satisfaction?

According to a Dutch happiness expert Veenhoven, it refers to “the degree to which a person evaluates the overall quality of his or her present life-as-a-whole positively”.

Instant satisfaction is a passing, often sensory experience of life aspects – examples include listening to a great piece of music or eating a delicious piece of pie.

Domain satisfaction is all about enduring, continued appreciation of a life domain – being satisfied with your academic career, or your marriage.

Top Experience describes passing satisfaction with your life all in all; short-lived but intense, as “a moment of happiness”.

Finally, Core Meaning/Happiness refers to enduring, overall satisfaction with life. It is considered as ‘durable’ and authentically described as ‘life satisfaction.'

If we summarize the facts, we find that satisfaction is actually associated with subjective well-being
