People with emotional vulnerabilities, mental health concerns, and dysfunctional behaviors often suffer from one common problem: an unbalanced sense of self-recognition and identity. There is a tendency among them to engage in destructive acts that are self-sabotaging and can cause long-term adverse effects to your mind and body. In case, you can relate with this, and there is an urgent need for you to change such maladaptive behaviors while working up to your way to self-acknowledgment - the process of radical acceptance. As you develop a coherent approach of understanding yourself, it becomes straightforward to navigate the way towards a more confident, safe, and meaningful life.

## Radical Acceptance in DBT

In Dialectical Behavior Therapy, the word "dialectic" refers to the amalgamation and comparison of two contradictory things - the components of change and acceptance. Imagine undergoing a distressing situation, and you indulge in "black-and-white thinking" where your idea of what "should be" done overpowers you, you enter a loop of unnecessary suffering and destructive impulses. This is where you need the ultimate skill of Radical AcceptanceofDBT, where you are willing to let go of your habit of polarized thinking and accept the way you are at the present moment. When you radically agree with something, you adapt a non-judgmental stance towards it and avoid any attempt to change or fight against the current circumstance. For example, if you are radically accepting your present situation, you will acknowledge that everything that happens is the result of a long chain of events and you may or may not be responsible for your present moment. The reality is, no matter who or what caused your current moment, you have to accept it and attempt behavioral changes simultaneously.

When you radically accept yourself along with your current reality, you allow yourself to take charge of what is under your control and be responsible for your thoughts and actions. This is an enormously powerful strategy to build a life full of pride, confidence, and fulfillment.

## What causes suffering?

There is no widely-agreed or a single driving factor that causes suffering among humans. Think about particular events that happened before the "distressing situation". Observe your previous thoughts and try to analyze them without judgment or criticism. When you describe the factual information associated with the prompting event, you can finally realize what is causing you to indulge in impulses and destructive behaviors.

## When is Radical Acceptance used?

Radical acceptance is generally used in situations that are not in our hands. However, it's important to note that you must not use this skill in cases that need change, such as an abusive relationship or an unhealthy workplace. Radical acceptance is applied when circumstances are beyond your control, and you don't have a say on it. It can be used to the loss of a loved one, a shattering breakup, sudden loss of a job, or anything that you cannot control or change. Each of these events can be handled wisely if you accept them radically without responding to them with feelings of anger, denial, or criticism. The key to progression and happiness is to acknowledge your presence, as you evolve from ruminations of past and stagnation, and let yourself move on, finally.

## How to Practice Radical Acceptance?

Reality can be painful, and the idea of embracing it may look terrifying. However, the truth is denying its existence will not change anything. The fact will continue to be there for you to deal with it. Therefore, the best way to cope with such painful situations is to open yourself up to the present moment with no judgment or fury and witness the reality with radical acceptance. Radical acceptance is not merely a thought or idea, it's a comprehensive practice that involves various tenets to keep in mind.

* Accept yourself and your life for what they are - not for what you think they should be like
* Understand and acknowledge what is in your hand and what's not
* Analyze yourself and your life events without judgment or criticism
* Acknowledge the reality of yourself
* Practice mindfulness and be useful in your actions.
