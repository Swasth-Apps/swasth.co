Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)is a type of behavioral treatment applied to treat anxiety disorders. ACT along with a model called relational frame theory was created in 1986 by psychology professor Steven Hayes. Part of its roots lies in the values of Buddhist philosophy. The goal of ACT is the acceptance of one's automated negative thoughts rather than attempts of their elimination or reduction.

Although research shows Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is an effective form of therapy meant for anxiety issues, not everyone responds to it. Therefore, psychologists have curated Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to treat anxiety and apply this model in short or long-term individual, couples, or group therapy.

If you are opting for ACT, you must know how this type of therapy is different from more traditional behavioral approaches and how it works uniquely for different individuals. If you decipher it's principles and goals beforehand, it becomes easier for you to get the most out of it.

## What is ACT?

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is different from traditional western approaches because it states no presence of factual evidence that proves that to be "healthy" is normal.

Instead, ACT theorists argue that your automatic regular thoughts and beliefs can become destructive and turn you to indulge in dysfunctional behaviors.In addition, according to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, language is the root cause of human suffering. This is because it forms the base of negative ideas and emotions such as deception, prejudice, obsession, fear, and self-criticism and ignites harmful urges like self-harm and mindless eating.

## The Goal

The goal of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is not to completely get rid of your anxiety symptoms. In fact, according to ACT, an attempt to directly control or lessen your signs will actually deteriorate your condition.

While undergoing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, you will be motivated to enjoy a more meaningful life, accept the presence of pain and crisis in life, learn how to tackle such situations, and take action based on your experience and values. It is then expected that your symptoms will begin to diminish as a by-product of ACT therapy.

## 5 ACT skills to deal with Anxiety

![Anxiety](/img/anxiety-3.jpg "Anxiety")

### 1. Make a plan

Worrying about your future might seem convenient at a point, but it won't take you anywhere, nor will it allow you to make wise decisions. And even if you plan something, and it doesn't work out, remember you are never helpless.

So figure out what is in your control and make a plan to manage the risks effectively. Inform yourself of the facts and upcoming hurdles, but do not let yourself get overwhelmed by them.

It's good to acknowledge that, however good your plan is, you will be anxious. Therefore, the key is to accept the truth and act efficiently, based on the idea of what you can and what seems right.

### 2. Drop the rope

The problem with anxiety is that the harder we try to avoid it, the stronger it becomes.

It is equivalent to being in a tug of war with a huge chunk of rock. You are pulling it with all your strength to avoid falling in the bottomless pit present in between. The harder you pull, the more the rope gets entangled. Since you are losing a lot of energy, then what's the best alternative? DROP THE ROPE.

### 3. Pivot Towards What Matters

Anxiety is the price we pay for thinking about something too much. This means we can pivot our attention to focus on pleasant things around us or think of situations where we succeeded with ease.

### 4. Practice Self-Compassion

Self-compassion is an integral technique for de-escalating anxiety issues and changing our stained relationship with it.

### 5. See a therapist

If you prefer a meditative practice to analyze and reform your thought patterns Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be right. Your therapist will ask you to commit yourself to action that is in proportion to your acquired values, even if it causes you some physical or emotional distress in the beginning.

Many of the techniques taught by your psychologist will alleviate your anxiety issue through symptom reduction. Hence, being fully present in social situations and mindful of your actions will help you recover quickly.
