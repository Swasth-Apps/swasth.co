## **MEANING OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

Impostor Syndrome is the overwhelming feeling that you don't deserve your success. It convinces you that you're not as intelligent, creative, talented or skilled as you may seem. It is the suspicion that your achievements are down to luck, good timing or just being in the “right place at the right time.” And it is accompanied by the fear that, one day, you'll be exposed as a fraud.

Impostor Syndrome often strikes at moments of success: starting a new job, receiving an award or promotion, or taking on extra responsibility such as teaching others, starting your own business, or becoming a first-time parent.

These feelings can inspire you to work hard but only sometimes as you feel like you should work hard to actually deserve the position you are presently at. But in general they are most likely to affect your thinking ability and you are all up for negative thoughts.

Impostor syndrome, the notion that you’ve only succeeded due to luck, and not because of your talent or qualifications—was first identified in 1978 by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes. They theorized that women were uniquely affected by impostor syndrome.

## **CHARACTERISTICS OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

Imposter syndrome can be manifested in several ways but its manifestation occurs in the person suffering from it. People around may never be able to know about it as imposter syndrome barely shows any outside behavior which can affect others. Although it is difficult to  find out about the signs of the syndrome but some can be interpreted which are mentioned below:

* Attributing success to external factors
* Self -doubting your overall self and each capability.
* Always being dissatisfied with the task at hand and your role.
* Fear that you would fail to live up to expectations
* Always trying to overachieve
* Sabotaging your own success
* An inability to realistically assess your competence and skills

A person suffering from imposter syndrome can also face some serious mental problems such as:

* anxiety
* depression
* frustration
* lack of self-confidence

After all such troubles, people still believe in not getting caught as a fraudster or they feel like they might lose their position which leads to a vicious cycle of the syndrome.

## **CAUSES OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

There can be some causes of the imposter syndrome which leads to development of the syndrome. These causes could be as follows:

**UNDESERVED PRAISE**

If your parents or other significant adults in your life, for example, a grandparent, a family friend, a much older sibling has praised you for things and at times when you did not expect or think to deserve them, you might have become instilled with the sense that you were a phony and you were getting overly praised.

**NO PRAISE AT ALL**

Not having received praise at all could make you feel inadequate and rarely get up to the mark. Everyone, from a small child to the mature adult, could feel motivated and perhaps requires praise in order to nurture their self-esteem and sense of self-worth. 

**LACK OF ENTITLEMENT**

Being constantly judged and evaluated according to conditions of worth can foster the development of a troubled personality. Being compared and rewarded on the basis of meeting expectations of others can make you lose confidence in yourself and you might get stuck in a cycle of self-doubt. For example, being exposed to statements like.

**FAMILY LABELS**

If you grew up with siblings, you may have identified with a certain role in the family, like the “smart one,” the “sensitive one,” the “competitive one” and so on. The negative side of those family labels is that it can be hard to get rid of them even if a child’s behavior and disposition adapt away from that describing perception.
