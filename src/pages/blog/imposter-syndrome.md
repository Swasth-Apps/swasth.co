description: Impostor Syndrome is a psychological pattern in which individuals
  doubt their skills, talents, or accomplishments and have a persistent
  internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud". But it's not exactly another
  symptom of low self-esteem or excessive humility. It involves a constant fear
  of exposure, isolation, and rejection.

## **MEANING OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

Impostor Syndrome is the overwhelming feeling that you don't deserve your success. It convinces you that you're not as intelligent, creative, talented, or skilled as you may seem. It is the suspicion that your achievements are down to luck, good timing, or just being in the “right place at the right time.” And it is accompanied by the fear that, one day, you'll be exposed as a fraud.

Impostor Syndrome often strikes at moments of success: starting a new job, receiving an award or promotion, or taking on extra responsibility such as teaching others, starting your own business, or becoming a first-time parent.

These feelings can inspire you to work hard but only sometimes as you feel like you should work hard to actually deserve the position you are presently at. But in general, they are most likely to affect your thinking ability and you are all up for negative thoughts.

Impostor syndrome, the notion that you’ve only succeeded due to luck, and not because of your talent or qualifications—was first identified in 1978 by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes. They theorized that women were uniquely affected by impostor syndrome.

## **CHARACTERISTICS OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

![](static/img/imp3.jpg)

Imposter syndrome can be manifested in several ways but its manifestation occurs in the person suffering from it. People around may never be able to know about it as imposter syndrome barely shows any outside behavior which can affect others. Although it is difficult to  find out about the signs of the syndrome some can be interpreted which are mentioned below:

* Attributing success to external factors
* Self -doubting your overall self and each capability.
* Always being dissatisfied with the task at hand and your role.
* Fear that you would fail to live up to expectations
* Always trying to overachieve
* Sabotaging your own success
* An inability to realistically assess your competence and skills

A person suffering from imposter syndrome can also face some serious mental problems such as:

* anxiety
* depression
* frustration
* lack of self-confidence

After all such troubles, people still believe in not getting caught as a fraudster or they feel like they might lose their position which leads to a vicious cycle of the syndrome.

## **CAUSES OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

There can be some causes of the imposter syndrome which leads to the development of the syndrome. These causes could be as follows:

**UNDESERVED PRAISE**

If your parents or other significant adults in your life, for example, a grandparent, a family friend, a much older sibling has praised you for things and at times when you did not expect or think to deserve them, you might have become instilled with the sense that you were a phony and you were getting overly praised.

**NO PRAISE AT ALL**

Not having received praise at all could make you feel inadequate and rarely get up to the mark. Everyone, from a small child to a mature adult, could feel motivated and perhaps requires praise in order to nurture their self-esteem and sense of self-worth. 

**LACK OF ENTITLEMENT**

Being constantly judged and evaluated according to conditions of worth can foster the development of a troubled personality. Being compared and rewarded on the basis of meeting the expectations of others can make you lose confidence in yourself and you might get stuck in a cycle of self-doubt. For example, being exposed to statements like, “Your brother deserves to sit up front because he ate his food and you didn’t,” or “You don’t deserve to have dessert because you didn’t clean your room”.

**FAMILY LABELS**

If you grew up with siblings, you may have identified with a certain role in the family, like the “smart one,” the “sensitive one,” the “competitive one” and so on. The negative side of those family labels is that it can be hard to get rid of them even if a child’s behavior and disposition adapt away from that describing perception.

## **TYPES OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

## 1. The Perfectionist

 Perfectionists set extremely high goals for themselves, and when they fail to reach a goal, they experience major self-doubt and worry about measuring up. Whether they realize it or not, this group can also be control freaks, feeling like if they want something done right, they have to do it themselves.

## 2. The Superhero

Since people who experience this phenomenon are convinced that they’re phonies amongst colleagues, they often push themselves to working harder and harder to catch up. But this is just a false cover-up for their insecurities, and the workload may harm not only their own mental health but also their relationships with others.

## 3. The natural genius

Imposters set their internal limits impossibly high, just like perfectionists. But they don’t just judge themselves based on ridiculous expectations, they also judge themselves based on getting things right on the first try. When they’re not able to do something quickly or fluently, their alarm sounds.

## 4.The Soloist

Sufferers who feel as though asking for help reveals their phoniness are what Young calls Soloists. It’s OK to be independent, but not to the extent that you refuse assistance so that you can prove your worth.

## 5. The Expert

Experts measure their competence based on 'what' and how much they know or can do. Believing they will never know *enough*, they fear being exposed as inexperienced or unknowledgeable.

## **TREATMENT OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME**

**CBT**

In the case of impostor syndrome, CBT would help to target problems such as - 

* Generalized anxiety, which is observed in physiological signs – clammy palms, fiddling, tension, headaches, distraction-seeking, etc.
* Obsessive and paranoid thoughts – worrying about what people think, exaggerating small problems to large ones, and so on. This is especially true when receiving criticism from others.
* Strong shifts in the mood when receiving praise – going quickly from over-excitement to strong self-doubt. This one was particularly challenging since joining Intercom because there’s a strong feedback culture.

Opening up with a mental health professional may enable a person to identify the reason for their feelings, giving them the chance to tackle the underlying causes.
