description: Impostor Syndrome can be related to other feelings of self-doubt,
  such as fear of success , fear of rejection , or fear of failure . But it's
  not exactly an another symptom of low self-esteem, or excessive humility. It
  involves a constant fear of exposure, isolation and rejection.
