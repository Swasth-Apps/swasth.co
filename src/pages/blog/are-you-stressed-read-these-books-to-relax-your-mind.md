#### By Sophie Kinsella

![Confessions of a Shopaholic](/img/shopholoic.jpg "Confessions of a Shopaholic")

The protagonist, Becky Bloomwood, possesses a luxurious flat in one of the classiest neighborhoods of London. A fabulous social circle and a closet overflowing with the season's must-haves is every adult's dream. The sole problem is that she can't afford any of these luxuries. Her writing job at Successful SavingMagazine neither satisfies her mentally nor monetarily. Later, the bank's dismal letters stating the vast sums of money that she couldn't pay only bore her to tears. Eventually, a story arises that her front-page article initiates a chain of events that will transform her life, and the lives of everybody surrounding her, forever.

The brilliantly penned narrative is a perfect read for anyone who feels stressed and losing every hope in life. The hilarious schemes convey the story of a heroine who only grows stronger every time she weakens.
