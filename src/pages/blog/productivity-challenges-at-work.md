The human brain is more like an organic instrument: it needs to charge itself, arrange its existing data, and nurture its storage for higher performance. This is why many global businesses realize that stocking their offices with high-end technology is not enough. There is also an urgent need to promote a proactive working environment tailored to cater to the ergonomic needs to boost their efficiency levels. Corporations are currently turning to mental health wellness programs for their employees to nurture a healthy environment. According to behavioral economics and psychology, it's no longer feasible to measure productivity simply with numbers because people react differently to situations and have different approaches to complete their tasks. Business productivity has mostly been determined by performance indicators (KPIs) analyzing output and efficiency. Thus, addressing psychology can be a tough adjustment, leaving too many loopholes.

## Poor Mental Health is taking a toll on Business Performance

Millions of U.S. employees who don't turn to treatment for their mental health conditions see that their overall well-being, along with productivity at work has dramatically gone down.

### 1. Accomplishments

At times, an employee's accomplishments are reduced to the number of assignments finished, thereby breaking their morale down altogether. A 2013 survey showed 83% of employees assumed recognition for their contributions towards their job was a more fulfilling reward than any monetary compensation. Task completion is easy to measure, but accomplishments require a subjective sense of measurement.

### 2. Presenteeism

Presenteeism is yet another factor that leads to a low output level due to poor mental health. In a study called the "American Productivity Audit," researchers demonstrated that due to intense insecurities among employees regarding their jobs, they switch to spend overtime at work. As a result, although such circumstances might look beneficial from the top, it eventually cost U.S. employers more than $150 billion annually. According to research established by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2003, U.S. companies incurred a loss of $33 billion annually due to low productivity caused by depression alone. Other studies indicate that the cost of presenteeism out of depression far exceeds the cost of depression-related absenteeismâ€“a much more visible symptom of an employee's underlying mental health concern.

### 3. Unavailability of Remote Work

Research shows that employees who work from home are, in fact, thirteen percent more productive than their office counterparts. Although it may not sound like much, it is equivalent to an additional workday of productivity annually. Therefore, telecommuting, remote working arrangements and even working as a team, have proved to be an effective means of improving individual productivity, while at the same time reducing the fixed cost of running an office.

### 4. Engagement at Work

Engagement Matters. According to Dale Carnegie Research, "emotional and functional commitment an employee has to his or her organization" is of utmost importance. Companies with open gate policies and engaging employees outperform those without by up to 202%.
