**UNDERSTANDING BODY IMAGE**

Body image isn't how we actually look, rather it is the perception of how we look and our outer appearance. Body image is basically known to have 4 elements, first is, how we see our body, that is our noncognitive body image, but this isn't the actual representation of our body. Second is, the way we feel about our body which is an effective body image. Thirdly, how we think of our body which is basically the perceptual aspect. Fourthly, the behaviors we acquire as a result of above three, popularly known as behavioral body image.

Before jumping into conclusion, it is rather more important to know what exactly our problem is. Sometimes we may confuse general dissatisfaction with BDD while Body dysmorphia is not just a dissatisfaction but a condition which is most commonly linked with distress, depression, anxiety just to name a few. Those with the disorder remain all disturbed throughout the day with their minds preoccupied with the feeling of shame. Such people may also escape from social gatherings like family function or just a get together. Thus, it becomes so important to check on what you are actually going through. Our cognitive health experts help you in your journey with RESILIENS to stand by your side and gain confidence within yourself. 

## **WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO GET RID OFF BODY DYSMORPHIA?**

Body dysmorphia can be rooted in different forms depending upon the individual.  In most of the cases, a particular part of the body is the zone of concern, while some may perceive flaws in some other forms causing them to get distressed. Several elements play big roles when it comes to full body appearance. Usually just like other cognitive health issues, body dysmorphia also preoccupies your brain as a result of early life experiences and triggers.

These forms could be anything from below mentioned entities, such as:

Muscle Dysmorphia: People with this kind of dysmorphia usually feel that they do not have enough muscles or their body is too small.

BDD by proxy: In this case, people usually get panicked seeing the appearance of others and remain stressed letting their mind all occupied by negative thoughts.

" *I hate everything about myself" :* People with BDD might face such kind of mental abnormality and often caught saying things like " I hate everything about myself", these people are basically ashamed of about about their concerns".

" *My face is asymmetrical":* Studies found out that many people worry about that at least one part of their body is unsymmetrical but usually they stay concerned about their their faces.

" *My face is falling":* After a long discussion it was clarified that such people believe that their facial muscles are weal and skin is sagging.

" *I am not feminine enough":* This kind of form is found in women in which they become too concerned about their facial hair growth and consider themselves as not so feminine women.

Fear of future: *"soon I will be bald":* This form usually makes people pretty worried that their present concern might enlarge to a great extent in the future.

"*I look depressed":* It is a less common form in which people see themselves as a depressed person.

*" I am afraid My Nose Will Break!":* In this sort of BDD, people are fearful as they believe that their concerned part is too fragile to break easily.

 But knowing the cause and working on it isn't something that can be achieved without an expert's help. You need to come out of your sphere to stir the cause with the company of an expert who can lead your way through the darkest to the brightest. This is what we provide you with.
