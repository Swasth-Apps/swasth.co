# Understanding burnout

![](static/img/review-cognitive-restructuring.png)

Many of us know someone who has had to take a break from work due to burnout. But what exactly is this set of symptoms? And what's the difference between burnout and "normal" exhaustion.

Burn-out is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is characterized by three dimensions:

* feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion;
* increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and
* reduced professional efficacy.

Burn-out refers specifically to phenomena in the occupational context and should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life.

The term ‘burnout’ is generally used in common informal conversations to describe fatigue and exhaustion. It is not a situation-based or occasional workplace crisis, but rather a chronic response to everyday stress.

The second dimension of burnout is feelings of depersonalization. Those who experience burnout often develop negative feelings towards those who, at the receiving end of their services, that is, clients, patients, students, etc.

The third dimension of burnout is reduced personal accomplishments. They tend to become ineffective. Such people feel a loss of self-confidence and belief.

# **Understanding stress**

These days, it can sometimes seem as if *stress* is a synonym for *life.* Whether it’s your harried morning commute, a boss piling on just one more deadline, or a suddenly sick kid, it’s all too easy to shift from chilled out to stressed out — that overwhelmed, slightly sweaty, breathless feeling that makes it hard to think and function clearly (and ups the chances that you’ll snap at whoever happens to be in your vicinity. Stress is becoming more and more a part of everyday life).

To cope with stress effectively, one must recognize:

* The existence of stress
* Personal automatic stress responses such as difficulty in sleeping, digestive problems, etc.
* Events that are likely to produce stress responses such as work overload, leaving late from work, etc.
* Your own personal ways to cope with stress such as physical exercise.

  # **Exploring the relationship between burnout and stress**

   Feelings of inadequate control over one’s work, frustrated hopes and expectations, and the feeling of loss of life’s meaning seem to be independent causes of burnout, a term that describes a condition of professional exhaustion. Burnout is more common than generally believed and may affect every aspect of the individual’s functioning, have a deleterious effect on interpersonal and family relationships, and lead to a negative attitude towards life in general. Empirical research suggests that burnout and stress are separate entities, although they may share several ‘qualitative’ characteristics, especially in the more severe forms of burnout, and in vulnerable individuals, low levels of satisfaction derived from their everyday work. 

  People who experience burnout tend to no longer believe in the work they are doing and many suggest burnout as a gradual erosion of their spirit due to chronic stress or daily hassles. Stress is not the only reason for burnout. It has been observed that people flourish in stressful situations as well. 

  # Causes of workplace burnout and stress 

  #### Work overload

  Organizations often push their workers to get maximum work done beyond what they can sustain. Workload involves how much you do and what you do.

  1. Work is more intense- Downsizing and other strategies increase productivity and fewer people do more work.

  2. Work demands more time- Long and hectic workweek is exhausting as people work for long periods of time but are still unable to meet the overwhelming demands.

  3. Work is getting complex- With downsizing, every individual is taking more than one role and thus jobs are becoming more complex.

  #### Lack of control

  Without an appropriate amount of control they are not able to be creative in their work and it becomes difficult for them to balance the interests of the organization with their own.

  #### Insufficient reward

   Intrinsic reward may also be rewarding, but with constantly changing nature of work and increased workload, employees are not able to work thoroughly.

  #### Breakdown of community

  Excessive focus on profits and loss of security has undermined consideration of people resulting in breakdown of community.  This is also evident from greater conflicts among people, less mutual support and respect.

  #### Absence of fairness

  For an organization to be fair, 3 elements must be essentially present: trust, openness and respect. All of these are important for an individual to feel that he is being valued.

  #### Value conflict

  Employees are aggravated and find it difficult to work in an environment where quantity and production is emphasized over quality of product or service.
