about: <p>Tiffany Loggins, Psy.D. is a licensed psychologist and mental health
  wellness speaker. She specializes in minority stress within BIPoC (Black,
  Indigenous, &amp; People of Color) communities, emotional resilience, and
  eating disorders.&nbsp;</p><p>She completed her dissertation and several
  studies on intersectionality of cultural identities, and&nbsp; worked with
  historically marginalized groups within various settings. These include
  developing programs and providing psychotherapy in universities with students
  of color to address mental health stigma.</p><p>She also has gained valuable
  experience in non-profit community-based settings by providing services to
  vulnerable populations including undocumented individuals, and children and
  family victims of physical and sexual abuse.&nbsp;Given her clinical
  experiences serving and empowering diverse marginalized groups, she
  intricately intertwines multicultural and evidenced-based approaches to
  cultivate a safe space of active learning to help individuals improve
  emotional resilience and illuminate new insights that accompany feelings of
  direction and purpose.</p><p>She has taken her passion and expertise to combat
  effects of trauma and systemic discrimination to societal levels by developing
  and delivering culturally sensitive psycho-educational talks and workshops to
  help both individuals and organizations acquire a toolbox of coping skills to
  improve their general mental health, strengthening ally-ship, and quality of
  life on their journey of transformation and innovation, even in the midst of
  adversity.</p><p>She believes therapy is not a one-size will fit all. She
  utilizes an integrative approach by incorporating evidence-based techniques of
  Dialectal (DBT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and
  Commitment Therapy (ACT) to help individuals to uncover untapped inner
  strengths and resiliencies and establish lifestyle changes to avoid
  suffering.</p><p>She focuses on mutual collaboration to create a unique
  approach catered to each individual, as one should be the author of their own
  journey to healing and growth. She currently has a private practice,
  <em>Discover the Authentic Self,</em> where she provides psychotherapy to
  individuals and couples to help them in their process of transformation and
  personal growth.</p><p>In addition, she collaborates with various
  technological companies, organizations, and schools to promote social
  responsibility and DEI efforts by providing culturally sensitive programming
  to employees, teachers, parents, and students across the U.S.</p>
