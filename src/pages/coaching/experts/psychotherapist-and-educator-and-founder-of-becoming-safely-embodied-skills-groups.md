about: '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deirdre Fay, MSW, works with people
  who have had crummy histories to develop an inner platform to get their needs
  met and have success in all areas of life.&nbsp; With over 30 years of
  experience as a psychotherapist and educator, Deirdre brings together modern
  science with ancient wisdom traditions in exploring the Transformational
  Journey of life which has been called a radically positive approach to healing
  trauma. Deirdre&rsquo;s message resonates deeply with those who may look
  successful on the surface, but internally feel plagued by shame, anxiety,
  distress, depression &ndash; wondering why they&rsquo;re stuck in repeating
  relational and life patterns.&nbsp; Her third book Becoming Safely Embodied
  (2021) became a best-seller before it was published.</span></p><p><span

  Recovery and co-author of Attachment Disturbances for Adults</strong><span
