  mark on psychology throughout the world.</p><p>Perhaps best known for the
  Stanford Prison Experiment of 1971, he has written more than 50 books and
  published several hundred articles. He is Emeritus Professor of Psychology at
  Stanford University and founder of the Heroic Imagination Project, a
  non-profit organization that recognizes and promotes everyday
  heroism.</p><p>The Stanford Prison Experiment remains one of the most famous
  social psychology experiments in history. Dr Zimbardo's study saw research
  participants become 'prisoners' and 'guards' in a mock prison. Dr Zimbardo was
  also a notable commentator on the Abu Ghraib prison torture in Iraq, drawing
  parallels between the abuse and the Stanford Prison Experiment.</p><p>Some of
  Dr Zimbardo's most influential research has been on shyness, heroism, the
  psychology of evil, and cult behavior. He has authored several essential
  textbooks as well as books for a general readership such as&nbsp;<em>The
  Lucifer Effect</em>&nbsp;(2007), \_The Time Paradox \_(2009),
  and&nbsp;<em>Living and Loving Better with Time Perspective
  Therapy</em>&nbsp;(2012). He also created the popular television
  series&nbsp;<em>Discovering Psychology.</em></p><p>Dr Zimbardo has received
  countless honors and accolades throughout his career, and in 2018 was named
