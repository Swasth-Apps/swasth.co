programId: c2ef0370-8323-11eb-9069-1fdfe9fe5c67
sequence: 116
overview: >-
  <p><span>Each one of us sets certain goals for ourselves and try our best to
  achieve them. However, there is a difference between the healthy pursuit of
  excellence and unhelpful perfectionism.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In unhelpful perfectionism, the person may evaluate their worth on how well they think they achieve their own high standards. Their self-esteem is dependent on the achievement of goals. </span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, even if pursuing goals results in negative consequences, those with unhelpful perfectionism may continue to strive to achieve them.</span></p>
