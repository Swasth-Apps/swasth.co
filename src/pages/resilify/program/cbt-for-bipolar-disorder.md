overview: <p>Bipolar disorder comes under the mood disorder spectrum and refers
  to the experience of abnormal moods or exaggerated mood swings. The
  characteristic nature of this condition involves experiencing extremely “high”
  moods or manic episodes where one becomes extremely euphoric or elated and
  experiencing extremely “low” moods or depressive episodes where one becomes
  extremely sad and finds it difficult to experience pleasure.</p><p>These
  episodes can range from mild to severe and affect social, occupational and
  personal functioning. However, it is important to remember that some people
  may experience different patterns associated with their disorder. For example,
  some people may experience only one episode of mania but more frequent
  episodes of depression and other such variations.</p>
