overview: >-
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever we want to change an aspect of our
  lives such as our emotions, maladaptive thoughts or behavior, one can start
  from enlisting it first. </span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring our emotions, behaviors and situations that trigger them helps us to become explicitly aware of our anxiety and thereby is the first step to change them. </span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-monitoring is the single most important technique used in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). It is important especially for self-directed change and self-regulation.</span></p>
