overview: <p>Think of your greatest achievements. Do you feel proud of what
  you've accomplished? Or do you feel like a fraud? Does each raise, promotion
  or accomplishment bring joy? Or is it accompanied by the dread that, one day,
  your cover will be blown, and everyone will find out that you just got
  lucky?</p><p>Such feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt when become intense
  turn into a condition most of us are not familiar with. </p><p>Impostor
  Syndrome is the overwhelming feeling that you don't deserve your success. It
  convinces you that you're not as intelligent, creative or talented as you may
  seem.</p>
