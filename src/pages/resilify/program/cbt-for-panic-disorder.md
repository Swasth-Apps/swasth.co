overview: >-
  <p>Panic disorder involves recurrent unexpected panic attacks and concerns
  about an anticipated increase in the number of future panic attacks. Thus the
  individual changes his or her behavior in maladaptive ways because of the
  panic attacks (e.g., avoidance of exercise or of unfamiliar locations).</p>

In order to be categorized as having a limited-symptom attack, the individual experiences fewer than four symptoms.</p>
