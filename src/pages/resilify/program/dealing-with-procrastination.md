title: Dealing with Procrastination
image: procrastination.jpg
overview: >-
  <p>Procrastination can be considered to be a process involving acts and
  patterns. "Procrastination acts" are random and inconsistent, specific to
  particular aspects only. You postpone returning a library book until after
  it's overdue.</p>

  <p>You finished the book. But you don't want to go out of your way to return it on time. This is an isolated occurrence since you typically promptly return what you borrow.</p>

  <p>On the contrary procrastination patterns are predictable and consistent habitual delays that are not situation specific, but follow an identifiable sequence.</p>

  <p>This kind of a sequence involves an initial feeling of discomfort about a task and then aimlessly moving to another task which perhaps might be irrelevant.  </p>
