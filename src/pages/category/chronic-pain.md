title: Chronic Pain
date: 2021-06-05
description: "Chronic pain is a kind of pain that lasts weeks to years. This
  pain arises as a result of inflammation in the body or dysfunctional nerves.
  Usually it is self-diagnosable, and medium term pain can be cured within
  months and lab tests or imaging is rarely required. Most people get back to
  the normal state after treatment of the pain but sometimes the pain carries on
  for longer due to some medical history or injury. "
