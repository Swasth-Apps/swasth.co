title: DBT for Self-Harm
date: 2021-06-10
description: Self-harm, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, are transdiagnostic
  difficulties. Self-harm is often viewed as a behavioral strategy which is
  implemented as a consequence of difficulty in regulating effect. Therapeutic
  approaches for working with self-harm include risk-management planning,
  developing and practicing effective emotional regulation strategies, and
  reducing reactivity to triggers for self-harm. DBT states, self-harm is the
  behavioral consequence of distressing thoughts and emotions. Individuals who
  self-harm may be experiencing high levels of affect and often have few or
  ineffective coping strategies.
